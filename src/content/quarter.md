Before you go anywhere else, let me explain what this is. It’s an experiment I’m running to address a problem I face with reading. If you’re here, I believe you enjoy reading and exploring new concepts, especially in business, science, or economics. My problem is that I often miss the key points in books, getting lost in the details—a phenomenon I call “Reading with the eyes, and not the brain.” Despite reading works by brilliant minds like Tesla, Hoffman, Thiel, and Kahneman, I often gain little from them. My solution is a tool that allows you to control the degree of summarization of the content you're reading. If you get lost in details, a slider can help summarize the current paragraph and its context, letting you "zoom out" as needed. This approach, unlike existing tools like Blinkist, which overly condense content, aims to help you better reorient yourself. Please check the demo in the left sidebar. It’s scrappy and buggy, but I'd rather be embarrassed now than spend time on incorrect solutions. Criticism and suggestions for improvement are welcome, but dismissing the problem as too difficult isn’t helpful.
