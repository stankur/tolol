Before you go anywhere else, let me tell you what this whole thing is. It’s an experiment I'm running to tackle a problem I face with reading. If I've invited you here, I believe you enjoy reading and find new concepts interesting, especially those that enhance your understanding of fields like business, science, or economics. My issue is that I sometimes read books and miss the key points the authors are making, often getting lost in the details they add. This phenomenon is sometimes called “Reading with the eyes, and not the brain.” Despite having the opportunity to glimpse the minds of brilliant individuals like Nikola Tesla, Reid Hoffman, Peter Thiel, and Daniel Kahneman, I often end up gaining very little from their works.

My proposed solution is a tool allowing you to control the degree of summarization of the content you're reading. If you lose track of the context amid the small details, a slider can summarize the current paragraph and its relevant neighbors, helping you "zoom out" a bit to reorient yourself. If faced with an overwhelming wall of text, you can zoom out as much as needed until you feel comfortable. While my solution might not be perfect and could be addressing the issue incorrectly, existing tools like Blinkist aren't solving the problem adequately either, as they overly condense content regardless of its complexity. Please check the demo in the left sidebar. Apologies for its scrappiness and bugs—I'd rather be embarrassed now than invest time in incorrect solutions. Criticism and improvements are welcome, but simply dismissing the problem as too difficult isn't helpful.
