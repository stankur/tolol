### About Paul Graham

Under this page, I'd like to introduce you to Paul Graham, a prominent figure in the tech industry. According to Wikipedia, Paul Graham (/ɡræm/; born November 13, 1964) is an English-American computer scientist, writer, entrepreneur, and investor. Renowned for developing the programming language Arc and co-founding the startup accelerator Y Combinator, Graham also created the startup Viaweb (later Yahoo! Store). He’s authored several influential programming books, such as *On Lisp*, *ANSI Common Lisp*, and *Hackers & Painters*. Technology journalist Steven Levy has aptly described him as a "hacker philosopher." Though born in England, Graham spent 48 years in the United States where he completed his education before returning to his native country in 2016.

In 1968, Graham and his family relocated to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he later attended Gateway High School. Influenced by his father, a nuclear physicist, Graham developed a keen interest in science and mathematics. He earned a Bachelor of Arts with a major in philosophy from Cornell University in 1986. Following this, he achieved a Master of Science in 1988 and a Doctor of Philosophy in 1990, both in computer science from Harvard University. Additionally, Graham has pursued studies in painting at the Rhode Island School of Design and the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence.

In 1996, Graham and Robert Morris founded Viaweb, recruiting Trevor Blackwell soon after. They believed Viaweb was the first application service provider. Graham later received a patent for webapps based on his work with Viaweb, which allowed users to create Internet stores using software primarily written in Common Lisp. In 1998, Viaweb was sold to Yahoo! for $49.6 million and became Yahoo! Store. Graham gained recognition for his essays on various topics, ranging from programming languages to high school nerd life, and published a collection titled *Hackers & Painters*. In 2001, he began working on a new Lisp dialect named Arc, releasing it in 2008. Some Y Combinator projects, including Hacker News, were developed using Arc. In 2005, after a Harvard talk, Graham, along with Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Morris, founded Y Combinator, which has since invested in over 1300 startups such as Reddit, Dropbox, and Airbnb. Graham was featured in BusinessWeek’s 2008 list of The 25 Most Influential People on the Web. He took a stand against SOPA in 2011 by excluding supporters from Y Combinator events. In 2014, he stepped down from his daily role at Y Combinator and announced another Lisp dialect named Bel in 2019.
