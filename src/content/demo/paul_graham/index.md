Under this page, I offer you to see the writings of Paul Graham. I am going to show you a copy of who this guy is from Wikipedia.

**Paul Graham** ([/ɡræm/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English"); born November 13, 1964)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-DOB_LibCongress-3) is an English-American [computer scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist "Computer scientist"), writer, entrepreneur and investor. His work has included the programming language [Arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_\(programming_language\) "Arc (programming language)"), the startup [Viaweb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viaweb "Viaweb") (later renamed *Yahoo! Store*), co-founding the [startup accelerator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_accelerator "Startup accelerator") and seed capital firm [Y Combinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator "Y Combinator"), his essays, and [Hacker News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_News "Hacker News").

He is the author of the computer programming books *[On Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Lisp "On Lisp")*,[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-onlisp-4) *ANSI Common Lisp*,[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-ansi-5) and *[Hackers & Painters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_%26_Painters "Hackers & Painters")*.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-hackersandpainters-6) Technology journalist [Steven Levy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Levy "Steven Levy") has described Graham as a "hacker philosopher".[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-7)

Graham was born in England, where he and his family have maintained a permanent residence since 2016. He is also a citizen of the United States, where he attended all of his schooling and lived for 48 years prior to returning to England.

## Education and early life

Graham and his family moved to [Pittsburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh "Pittsburgh"), [Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania "Pennsylvania") in 1968, where he later attended [Gateway High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_High_School_\(Pennsylvania\) "Gateway High School (Pennsylvania)"). Graham gained interest in science and mathematics from his father who was a [nuclear physicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_physicist "Nuclear physicist").[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-early_interest-8)

Graham received a [Bachelor of Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts "Bachelor of Arts") with a major in [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy") from [Cornell University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University "Cornell University") in 1986.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-bio-9)[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-10)[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-11) He then received a [Master of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Science "Master of Science") in 1988, and a [Doctor of Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy "Doctor of Philosophy") in 1990, both in [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science") from [Harvard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University "Harvard University").[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-bio-9)[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-SpeakerMix_bio-12)

Graham has also studied painting at the [Rhode Island School of Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island_School_of_Design "Rhode Island School of Design") and at the [Accademia di Belle Arti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accademia_di_Belle_Arti_Firenze "Accademia di Belle Arti Firenze") in [Florence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence "Florence").[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-bio-9)[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-SpeakerMix_bio-12)

## Career\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Career")\]

In 1996, Graham and [Robert Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Tappan_Morris "Robert Tappan Morris") founded [Viaweb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viaweb "Viaweb") and recruited [Trevor Blackwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Blackwell "Trevor Blackwell") shortly after. They believed that Viaweb was the first [application service provider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_service_provider "Application service provider").[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-13) Graham received a patent for webapps based on his work at Viaweb.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-14) Viaweb's software, written mostly in [Common Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp "Common Lisp"), allowed users to make their own [Internet stores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_store "Internet store"). In the summer of 1998, after [Jerry Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Yang "Jerry Yang") received a strong recommendation from [Ali Partovi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Partovi "Ali Partovi"),[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-15) Viaweb was sold to [Yahoo!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo! "Yahoo!") for 455,000 shares of Yahoo! stock, valued at $49.6 million.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-16) After the acquisition, the product became [Yahoo! Store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Store "Yahoo! Store").

Graham later gained notice for his essays, which he posts on his personal website. Essay subjects range from *Beating the Averages*,[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-17) which compares Lisp to other [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language") and introduced the hypothetical programming language *Blub*, to *Why Nerds are Unpopular*,[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-18) a discussion of [nerd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerd "Nerd") life in high school. A collection of his essays has been published as *[Hackers & Painters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_%26_Painters "Hackers & Painters")*[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-hackersandpainters-6) by [O'Reilly Media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Reilly_Media "O'Reilly Media"), which includes a discussion of the growth of Viaweb and the advantages of Lisp to program it.

In 2001, Graham announced that he was working on a new [dialect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect_\(computing\) "Dialect (computing)") of Lisp named [Arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_\(programming_language\) "Arc (programming language)"). It was released on 29 January 2008.[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-19) Over the years since, he has written several essays describing features or goals of the language, and some internal projects at Y Combinator have been written in Arc, including the Hacker News web forum and news aggregator program.

In 2005, after giving a talk at the [Harvard Computer Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Harvard_Computer_Society&action=edit&redlink=1 "Harvard Computer Society (page does not exist)") later published as *How to Start a Startup*, Graham along with [Trevor Blackwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Blackwell "Trevor Blackwell"), [Jessica Livingston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Livingston "Jessica Livingston"), and [Robert Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Tappan_Morris "Robert Tappan Morris") started [Y Combinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator "Y Combinator") to provide [seed funding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_funding "Seed funding") to [startups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company "Startup company"), particularly those started by younger, more technically oriented founders. Y Combinator has invested in more than 1300 startups, including [Reddit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit "Reddit"), [Twitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_\(service\) "Twitch (service)") (formerly [Justin.tv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin.tv "Justin.tv")), [Xobni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xobni "Xobni"), [Dropbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropbox_\(service\) "Dropbox (service)"), [Airbnb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb "Airbnb"), and [Stripe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stripe_\(company\) "Stripe (company)").[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-20)

*[BusinessWeek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BusinessWeek "BusinessWeek")* included Paul Graham in the 2008 edition of its annual feature, *The 25 Most Influential People on the Web*.[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-21)

In response to the proposed [Stop Online Piracy Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act "Stop Online Piracy Act") (SOPA), Graham announced in late 2011 that no representatives of any company supporting it would be invited to Y Combinator's Demo Day events.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-Demo_Day_SOPA_cutoff-22)

In February 2014, Graham stepped down from his day-to-day role at Y Combinator.[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-23)

In October 2019, Graham announced a [specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_specification "Technical specification") for another new dialect of Lisp, written in itself, named Bel.[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-24)
