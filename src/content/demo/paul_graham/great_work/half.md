If you gathered techniques for doing great work across various fields, what would their commonalities look like? Driven by this curiosity, I decided to create such a guide, usable by anyone, regardless of their field. Through this exercise, I discovered that these common strategies indeed form a definite structure rather than just a vague notion like "work hard." This recipe for great work starts with the assumption that you're highly ambitious. The first step is choosing what to work on. Your chosen work must have three essential traits: it should align with your natural talents, deeply interest you, and provide ample opportunity to produce outstanding work.

You don't need to stress much about determining the third criterion of work. Ambitious individuals are often already quite cautious about this. Instead, focus on finding something you have both an aptitude for and a great interest in, which can be challenging. When you're young, you're unaware of your true strengths or the nature of various careers, particularly those that don't yet exist. While some people have clear ambitions early on, most need to figure it out through experience. If undecided, simply guess and start working on something; trial and error is fine and will help you understand various fields. Cultivate a habit of pursuing your own projects, as the most significant work you'll do will likely be driven by your own ambitions. Your projects should be whatever excites you most. Over time, what's exciting and what’s important will converge, evolving from simple interests to more complex inquiries. Preserve your enthusiasm and curiosity, as these will guide you toward the right projects. Your excessive curiosity — even if it bores others — is the key to discovering your path.

When you’re intensely interested in something, dive deep enough to reach the frontiers of knowledge where gaps and opportunities for discovery lie. Spotting these gaps takes skill, as our brains often overlook them for simplicity. Embrace unconventional ideas and boldly pursue outlier concepts that excite you, even if others ignore them. This process involves four steps: choose a field, learn extensively, notice gaps, and explore promising ones. Hard work is essential and driven by deep interest. The system assumes you'll magically guess your field early, but often, finding your path involves luck and curiosity-driven experimentation. By trying various things, meeting different people, and reading widely, you increase your chances of finding your passion. Optimize for what’s interesting to you, even if your interests seem unusual. Enjoying the tedious parts of a field is a good sign of suitability, but remain flexible and switch paths if you discover something more exciting along the way.

If you're creating something for people, make sure it's something they actually want by making something you, yourself, want. This aligns with the excitingness rule; the most thrilling story to write is the one you want to read. Many falter by aiming to please an imaginary, sophisticated audience instead of themselves. Several distractions—like pretentiousness, fashion, and money—can lead you astray, but genuine interest will keep you on track. This strategy requires boldness and a willingness to face rejection and failure, but not exhaustive planning. Great work often arises from hard work on ambitious projects rather than meticulous planning. Known as "staying upwind," this approach involves doing whatever seems most interesting and offers the best future options at each stage. However, working on something exciting isn't always straightforward; it requires technique and perseverance, much like sailing through headwinds and hidden shoals.

Working too hard can lead to diminishing returns due to fatigue, reducing productivity and potentially harming your health. The optimal work period varies by task, with some requiring only four or five hours of concentrated effort, ideally uninterrupted. Arrange your schedule to allow large blocks of work time to avoid interruptions, which can deter starting hard tasks. Overcoming the initial resistance to begin work often requires psychologically tricking oneself, acknowledging that the mental threshold to start is higher than that to continue. Telling small lies to yourself, such as taking advantage of the "How hard could it be?" mindset, can catalyze project initiation, especially for younger, more optimistic individuals. Finish what you start, as significant progress often materializes in the final stages of a project. Additionally, considering your work exceedingly important can drive motivation and possibly lead to genuine significant discoveries.

There are two types of procrastination: per-day and per-project, with the latter being much more dangerous. Per-project procrastination involves delaying the start of ambitious projects because the timing never feels right, leading to years of inaction. This type of procrastination is particularly insidious because it camouflages itself as productivity; you're not idle, but diligently working on other tasks, and therefore, it doesn’t raise the same alarms as daily procrastination. To combat this, periodically ask yourself if you are working on what you truly want to work on. While it's acceptable for young people to occasionally say no, this becomes increasingly perilous with age. Achieving great work often requires dedicating an exceptional amount of time to a problem, which shouldn't be viewed as a cost but rather enjoyed as a compelling endeavor.

Great work isn't about slogging away at something you hate for years; it's about consistently dedicating yourself to something you're genuinely passionate about. The cumulative effect of consistent work can be astonishing—writing a mere page a day can result in a book a year. The key is consistency. Great achievements are often made by completing small tasks regularly, leading to exponential growth. This growth, though seemingly flat at first, soon accelerates, creating significant value over time. Whether it's learning or building an audience, the more you invest, the more you gain. Often, we underestimate this process and push through early stages unconsciously, realizing later the importance of initial efforts. Additionally, undirected thinking, such as when walking or showering, can spur innovative solutions, but it requires the foundation of deliberate work. Hence, a blend of persistent effort and occasional mind-wandering can lead to remarkable successes.

Avoiding distractions at work is crucial, but it's equally important to avoid distractions during downtime that push your work out of focus. Letting your mind wander should center on what you care about most, except for love. Consciously develop your taste in work within your field; understanding the best and why it's the best will help you aim higher. Many agree that aiming to be the best rather than just good is essential, possibly because ambition often falls short of the target, or because striving for the best is a different, more motivating endeavor. Trying to be the best can be more liberating and simpler than just aiming to be good. Aim to create work that will be valued in a century, as this is a good proxy for genuine quality.

Don't focus on crafting a distinctive style. Simply do your best; your unique style will emerge naturally. When you strive too hard for distinctiveness, it becomes artificial. True style flows effortlessly from your genuine efforts.

Affectation involves adopting a fake persona, often showing in one's work, with the temptation being greater among the young due to feelings of insignificance. However, undertaking ambitious projects inherently solves this by establishing one's identity through achievement. While avoiding affectation is advisable, a more positive approach is to be earnest, which encompasses being intellectually honest and willing to admit mistakes, thereby avoiding similar vices. Earnestness also includes informality, focusing on substance over appearance, a trait often seen in nerds who conserve their energy for real work rather than pretense. Although cynicism and pessimism may be advantageous in some fields, optimism is essential for groundbreaking work, even at the risk of looking foolish. Great work necessitates earnestness, as it aligns consistently with both the creator and itself, often requiring a willingness to redo parts to maintain this consistency. To combat laziness and status quo bias, one should consider if, having made a change, reverting to the previous state would be desirable.

Have the confidence to cut. Don't hold onto something that doesn't fit just because it makes you proud or because you put a ton of effort into it. In fact, in certain types of work, it's beneficial to strip down your project to its core. This will yield a more focused result, enhance your understanding, and prevent self-deception about the authenticity of your work.

Mathematical elegance might initially seem like a metaphor borrowed from the arts, as I once believed when I first encountered the term "elegant" for a proof. However, I've come to think it might actually be foundational — that artistic elegance derives from mathematical elegance. This notion of elegance extends beyond math, serving as a valuable standard in various fields. Elegance can be a long-term investment; while laborious solutions garner short-term prestige due to their complexity and the effort they demand, the finest work often appears effortless because it feels pre-existing, merely needing to be observed rather than constructed. The truest sign of brilliance in any creative endeavor is when it's unclear whether you're inventing something new or simply uncovering it.

When you're involved in work that straddles the line between creation and discovery, lean towards discovery. Adopt the mindset of being a mere conduit through which ideas naturally take shape.

Choosing a problem to work on is often viewed as a search but ideally resembles creating a new field during exploration. When building powerful tools, ensure they are unrestrictively designed, as they are likely to be used in unforeseen ways. Aim to create tools and ideas that others can build upon or answer questions with. The best ideas have wide-ranging implications and should be expressed in the most general form to reveal deeper truths. However, ideas must be both true and new, which requires a certain degree of skill to identify them once you reach the frontiers of knowledge.

In English, we attribute terms like originality, creativity, and imagination to a certain unique ability, which seems reasonable to label separately as it appears to be a distinct skill. One can possess substantial technical ability yet lack this creative flair. Personally, I dislike the term "creative process," as originality seems more of a habitual mindset than a process. Original thinkers continuously generate new ideas on whatever they concentrate on, similar to an angle grinder producing sparks. However, if their focus is on something unfamiliar, the ideas may not be particularly good. For instance, an original thinker I know, post-divorce, shifted his focus to dating, an area he was inexperienced in, resulting in notably colorful outcomes. Observing originality dissociated from expertise highlights its true nature. While it's unclear if originality can be cultivated, there are definite ways to maximize it. You're more likely to have original ideas when engaged in challenging work, as these ideas arise from the efforts to build or understand something complex, not from trying to be original. Discussing or writing about interesting subjects can also spur new thoughts, as attempting to articulate ideas can draw out the missing pieces. Changing your context, such as traveling or even just taking a walk, can help dislodge new ideas. Exploring various topics expands the "angle grinder's" surface area and often yields fruitful analogies, but rather than spreading your attention thinly across many areas, focus deeply on a few and remain idly curious about others. Curiosity nurtures originality by providing new material to work with and is akin to what questions are to originality's answers. Often, generating new ideas means seeing what was always in plain sight, leading to the paradox that once an idea is found, it often seems obvious.

When an idea strikes you as both novel and obvious at the same time, you can bet it's a good one.

Having new ideas is difficult because they often require a shift in perspective, which involves fixing broken models of the world. While our models help us, they also constrain us, making it hard to notice and correct their flaws. Once a broken model is fixed, new ideas become obvious, illustrating why they seem easy yet hard to discover. Being stricter than others can help identify broken models, as they leave clues against reality that most people ignore. Einstein's success in recognizing the implications of Maxwell's equations stemmed from his stricter view. Moreover, a willingness to break rules is essential for creating new models, as truly innovative ideas break implicit rules of old models and appear conservative only after they succeed. The heliocentric model took a century to be accepted because it initially felt wrong. Thus, good new ideas often seem bad initially; what you seek are ideas that are crazy in a way that is exciting and rich in implications. Recognizing them is uncertain since bad ideas can also seem crazy. Comfort with rule-breaking, whether enjoyed or disregarded, is crucial. Aggressively independent-minded people, who derive energy from breaking rules, find delight in the audacity of their projects, which helps them get started.

The other way to break rules is simply not to care about them or even know they exist, which is why novices and outsiders often make new discoveries; their ignorance of a field's assumptions brings a form of passive independent-mindedness. Similarly, people on the autism spectrum (Aspies) seem to possess an immunity to conventional beliefs, aiding them in generating new ideas. While popular culture pits strictness against rule-breaking, this is a flawed perspective, especially in significant matters where only rule-breakers can truly be stringent. Often, overlooked ideas are subconsciously dismissed because they seem too weird, risky, labor-intensive, or controversial. This opens up an intriguing possibility: if you could disable these filters, you'd see more innovative ideas. One way to achieve this is by considering what ideas might be valuable for others to explore, thereby circumventing your subconscious self-censorship.

You can uncover hidden ideas by examining what's obscuring them, particularly by challenging cherished but mistaken principles, which often create a dead zone of unexplored, valuable ideas. Religions exemplify such collections of flawed principles, meaning that anything metaphorically or literally resembling a religion will have untapped potential hidden in its shadow. Notable figures like Copernicus and Darwin made significant discoveries by confronting such prevailing beliefs. Reflect on what your field might be religious about—principles taken as self-evident but which may not be—and consider the possibilities that arise if you discard these assumptions. Interestingly, people show more originality in solving problems than in choosing which problems to tackle, with even the brightest minds often conservatively sticking to fashionable problems rather than exploring uncharted territory.

People tend to be more conservative when choosing problems to tackle rather than solutions because problems can be long-term commitments, occupying years, while solutions might only take days to explore. Yet this conservatism often goes too far, influenced by both risk aversion and fashion trends, undervaluing unfashionable problems. Some of the most rewarding work comes from revisiting problems deemed fully explored but rich with latent potential, as Durer and Watt demonstrated. Working on unfashionable problems can be gratifying, free from hype and scrutiny, and involves developing ideas that would otherwise be wasted. The most overlooked problems, however, aren't necessarily unfashionable but are underrated in importance. Finding such problems requires indulging your curiosity and setting aside the urge to only pursue "important" problems. The key to groundbreaking work lies in the originality of the problems you choose, as this often leads to discovering new fields. The ratio of question to answer in big ideas is misunderstood; the real insight frequently lies in the question itself.

Part of the reason we undervalue questions is their fleeting nature in schools, where they are answered quickly, much like unstable particles. However, truly great questions can be more than this—they are partial discoveries. They propel us into uncharted territory: How do new species arise? Is the force that pulls objects to the Earth the same as the one that keeps planets in orbit? Unanswered questions can be uncomfortable, but carrying them increases the likelihood of finding solutions or recognizing connections between them. Sometimes, these questions linger with us for years, even from childhood, driving significant discoveries. While people often emphasize the importance of maintaining youthful dreams, it's equally crucial to keep our youthful questions alive.

Experts aren't always certain; in fact, being puzzled about important, unexplored questions often leads to originality. Embrace puzzlement and be rich in unanswered questions, as exploring them generates even more inquiries. Rather than demanding grand questions, pull on the threads of curiosity and see what unravels. Small, prolific efforts often lead to big discoveries, though they come with failures. Favor starting small and evolving projects through successive versions, especially when creating for others, rather than over-planning. Take risks, as high rewards come from them, and avoid the conservatism that often accompanies inexperience.

Even a project that fails can hold immense value. Through the process, you get to explore uncharted territory and confront unique questions that others may not have even considered. There's no richer source of questions than those you come across by attempting something that’s just beyond your reach.

Use the advantages of youth—energy, time, optimism, and freedom—and those of age—knowledge, efficiency, money, and power—appropriately as you encounter them in life. While young, take advantage of your abundant time by engaging in slightly frivolous activities, experimenting, and exploring new interests. This approach allows learning through experience and fresh perspectives, sometimes discovering flaws in ideas that others ignore. As you grow older, discern what truly matters and eliminate insignificant concerns, focusing on impactful activities. Schools often foster passivity and limited views of learning, so dynamically engage with education. Rather than copying uncritically, leverage others' ideas openly and adapt them to create meaningful, original work. Recognize that even successful people have flaws and learn vicariously through both positive and negative examples. Embrace cross-field ideas and visit hubs of excellence for inspiration and self-belief. This balanced approach, from youth to age, can enrich your growth and achievements.

If you're genuinely interested, you'll likely receive a warmer welcome than anticipated from experts in any field, as they often enjoy discussing their work with earnest individuals. Outstanding professionals typically have a passionate, hobbyist-like dedication to their work, and finding such colleagues, though sometimes difficult due to the prestige associated with great work, is crucial. Universities, for instance, maintain a polite fiction that everyone produces high-quality work, though the reality varies greatly across departments. Seek out the best colleagues as their influence is crucial; they can offer fresh insights and support that can elevate your own work. Working with excellent colleagues is better than having many decent ones, as seen in historical clusters of greatness. You'll know you have good colleagues when they continuously surprise and challenge you. While everyone can benefit from collaboration, some projects require large-scale teamwork and effective management, which demands specific skills and dedication. If managing isn't your forte, you must either learn it or avoid such projects. Lastly, maintaining your morale is vital when working on ambitious endeavors, so nurture and protect it diligently.

Morale begins with your perspective on life. An optimistic outlook helps you produce great work, and considering yourself fortunate rather than a victim boosts your likelihood of success.

Indeed, work can offer a refuge from your problems. Engaging in pure work's intrinsic difficulties can be a productive form of escapism, as evidenced by some of the greatest minds in history. High morale fosters good work, which in turn boosts morale, creating a positive cycle. Conversely, poor work can demoralize, making the cycle spiral downward. Therefore, when stuck, switching to easier tasks can help maintain productivity and morale. A critical mistake ambitious individuals make is allowing setbacks to shatter their morale. To avoid this, consider setbacks as integral to the process. Tackling hard problems often requires backtracking. Hence, "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again" should be refined to: If at first you don't succeed, either try again or backtrack and then try again.

"Never give up" misses the mark slightly. Sometimes, ejecting is the right move. A more accurate motto would be: Never let setbacks make you backtrack more than necessary. And importantly: Never abandon the root node. Struggling doesn't inherently mean you're off course—think of it like being out of breath while running; it all depends on your speed. So, learn to tell the difference between good pain and bad pain. Good pain signifies effort, while bad pain indicates damage.

An audience is crucial for maintaining morale. Whether you're a scholar sharing your work with peers or an artist performing for an audience in the traditional sense, the size of your audience isn't as important as its quality. This is particularly uplifting for those just starting out since a small, dedicated audience can be immensely sustaining. Even if only a handful of people genuinely love what you do, that's sufficient. Whenever possible, try to bypass intermediaries between you and your audience. While this may not always be achievable in some fields, the liberation of directly connecting with your audience may be worth considering a switch to a related field where direct engagement is feasible.

The people you spend time with will significantly impact your morale. Some individuals will increase your energy, while others will decrease it, and these effects can often be surprising. Make it a point to seek out those who boost your energy and steer clear of those who sap it. However, if caring for someone is necessary, that responsibility should take precedence.

Don't marry someone who sees your work as competition for your attention. If you're ambitious, working is essential—almost like a medical necessity. If your partner prevents you from working, they either don't understand you or don't care. Remember, morale is physical; you think with your body. Therefore, maintain a healthy lifestyle by exercising regularly, eating and sleeping well, and avoiding dangerous drugs. Running and walking are great forms of exercise because they're good for thinking. Achievers aren't necessarily happier, but they're happier than they'd be if unproductive. Ambitious, intelligent folks who don't achieve can become bitter. It's okay to want to impress others, but focus on those you genuinely respect. Fame, or the approval of a larger, less significant group, is just noise.

The prestige of a type of work is often an afterthought and can sometimes be entirely wrong. If you excel at something, you'll make it prestigious. The essential question is not how prestigious a type of work is, but how well it can be done. While competition can motivate, don't let it dictate your choices; avoid pursuing something merely because others are. Let your curiosity be your guide—it never misleads and inherently knows what's worth your focus. Pursue what genuinely intrigues you, and you'll find your own path to success.

If you asked an oracle the secret to doing great work, my bet would be on "curiosity." Curiosity alone isn’t enough and you can't force it, but you can nurture it. It's essential across all four steps of doing great work: it guides you to a field, drives you to its frontier, highlights gaps, and compels you to explore them. This essay is long, partly to act as a filter; if you're still reading, you’re inherently interested in doing great work. This boils down to ability and interest, with effort assumed and luck disregarded as uncontrollable. Can you find work where your ability and interest spark new ideas? Likely, yes. The key challenge is finding that work and letting curiosity guide you. Many shy away from pursuing greatness, fearing failure and seeming presumptuous. Yet, are you willing to strive for great work? Now you're consciously deciding. Don’t worry about failing or seeming presumptuous; many face worse problems. Aim for greatness, and let curiosity drive you.

Yes, you'll have to work hard. But remember, lots of people have to work hard. If you're pursuing something fascinating, which you naturally will be if you're on the right path, the work will likely feel less burdensome than it does for many of your peers. The discoveries are out there, just waiting to be made. So, why not by you?
