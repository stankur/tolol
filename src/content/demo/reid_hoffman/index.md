Hoffman co-founded [LinkedIn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn "LinkedIn") in December 2002 with two former colleagues from SocialNet (including Allen Blue) from his time at Fujitsu.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-Crown_Business-7)[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-20) LinkedIn launched on May 5, 2003 as one of the first business-oriented online social networks.[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-LinkedIn:_About-21) [Peter Thiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel "Peter Thiel"), a colleague of Hoffman's at PayPal, invested in LinkedIn. At the time of LinkedIn's [IPO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPO "IPO") on May 19, 2011, Hoffman owned a stake worth an estimated $2.34 billion, not including any potential benefits from [Greylock Partners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greylock_Partners "Greylock Partners"), where he was named a partner in 2009.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-22)

[Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft") proposed to acquire LinkedIn on June 13, 2016 for $26.2 billion in cash.[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-23) Hoffman became a Microsoft board member on March 14, 2017.[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-24)

### **Artificial Intelligence ventures\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reid_Hoffman&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Artificial Intelligence ventures")\]**

Hoffman was a founding investor in the [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence") research company [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI "OpenAI")[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-25) and joined its board in 2018.[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-26)

In March 2022, it was announced that Hoffman was co-founding a new startup, [Inflection AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection_AI "Inflection AI"), with his long-time friend and Greylock colleague [Mustafa Suleyman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Suleyman "Mustafa Suleyman"), the co-founder of [DeepMind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepMind "DeepMind"). [CNBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC "CNBC") reported that "Headquartered in Silicon Valley, Inflection will aim to develop AI software products that make it easier for humans to communicate with computers."[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-Shead-1)

In late 2022, Hoffman and others invested a total of $2.2 million in JusticeText. “\[G\]eared towards public defenders,” the platform “stores, catalogs, analyzes and then shares video evidence, hoping to increase transparency around criminal matters.”[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-27)

On March 3, 2023, Hoffman resigned from his board seat at OpenAI, citing a desire to avoid conflicts of interest between his board seat at OpenAI, investments in AI technology companies via Greylock Partners, and role as founder of Inflection AI.[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-28)

As of May 2023, Hoffman and Greylock Partners have invested in at least 37 AI companies.[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-29) For example, they were an early investor in Tome, makers of productivity software driven by AI. The company claims it is the fastest productivity software maker to reach 1 million users.[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-30)

Hoffman has dismissed calls to “pause” the development of advanced AI systems, calling such ideas “foolish” and “anti-humanist.” Instead, he has called for the pace of development to be accelerated to help humans solve societal problems.[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-31) For example, he’s pointed to “its potential to transform areas like health care — “giving everyone a medical assistant”; and education — “giving everyone a tutor….I’m a tech optimist, not a tech utopian.”[\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-32)

[Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inc._\(magazine\) "Inc. (magazine)") dubbed Hoffman the “evangelist in chief” for Inflection AI and AI in general, citing his meetings with the likes of President Biden and the Pope to discuss his vision and concerns around AI.[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-33)[\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-34)

In April of 2024, Hoffman “sat down” for an interview with an AI deepfake of himself. “In their conversation, the two Reids discussed AI regulation, its capabilities, and ways Hoffman can improve his LinkedIn profile.” According to Hoffman, the bot was “built on [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI "OpenAI")'s GPT-4 and trained on over 20 years' worth of material provided by Hoffman's public speaking engagements and the books he's published.”[\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-35)
