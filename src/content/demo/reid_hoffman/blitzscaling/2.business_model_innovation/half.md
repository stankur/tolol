In Part II of the discussion on Business Model Innovation, it's clear that formulating an innovative business model is crucial for exponential growth, particularly in the Internet era. The dot-com boom of the late 1990s illustrated that simply transplanting existing business models onto the online medium often led to failure. Giants like Microsoft and Time Warner, as well as start-ups like eToys, faltered because they didn't adapt their models to the new medium. However, innovative business models propelled companies like Amazon, eBay, and Google to massive success. These companies redefined their industries with novel strategies—Amazon revolutionized e-commerce, Google monetized search, and Facebook changed social networking. Technological innovation alone wasn't enough; success required innovative products and services underpinned by innovative business models. The narrative underscores that a viable business model must generate financial returns, scale rapidly, and create a sustainable competitive edge, with companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook exemplifying these principles. The text concludes by emphasizing that while there is no one-size-fits-all business model, most successful ones share traits that maximize growth and minimize limits, highlighting the importance of market size as a key growth factor.

The most basic growth factor for your business model is market size, a fundamental concept for start-ups covered in Pitch Deck 101. If you aim to build a massive company, start by dismissing ideas that target too small of a market. A big market doesn't just mean a large number of potential customers; it also includes efficient channels to reach them. For instance, “everyone in the world” is a large market, but not easily accessible. This complexity in determining market size, or total available market (TAM), creates uncertainty in blitzscaling. However, correctly predicting TAM and investing when others are hesitant can lead to high returns, as demonstrated by Airbnb and Uber. A quickly growing market, even if initially small, can offer tremendous potential and make a sizable market even more appealing.

In Silicon Valley, the fierce competition for venture capital forces entrepreneurs to target large markets to promise substantial returns. Venture capital firms, funding through millions or even billions from entities like pension funds and university endowments, seek high returns that necessitate tripling their investments over a typical span of seven to ten years. This requires VCs to rely on a few exceptionally successful investments, such as Benchmark Capital's $6.7 million investment in eBay in 1997, which returned $5 billion, or a 745 times return. Consequently, VCs focus on ventures that can achieve "venture scale" of at least $1 billion in annual sales, often passing on smaller but otherwise viable businesses. Sam Altman advised Airbnb's Brian Chesky to project a market size in line with their ambitious vision, increasing their pitch from $30 million to $30 billion, which was more accurate. Companies like Uber exemplify this, surpassing initial market estimates through appealing innovations and expanding user bases. Similarly, Amazon's evolution from a bookstore to "the everything store" showcases how market expansion boosts a company's reach and profitability beyond initial projections.

Apple's financial results underscore the importance of distribution in sustaining and scaling a business. In Q1 2017, Apple's personal computer sales hit $7.2 billion, but this made up less than 10% of their $78.4 billion total revenue. As Greylock’s Jerry Chen observes, scaling requires a clear path from modest beginnings to massive outputs. Crucially, effective distribution is often more decisive for success than product quality alone. Dropbox thrived not just because of its great product but due to stellar distribution, a sentiment echoed by its CEO, Drew Houston, who finds many start-ups overlook this. In today’s mobile-first era, distributing apps is more challenging, necessitating innovative methods to reach broad audiences without hefty costs. This has led successful companies like Instagram and WhatsApp to utilize two main distribution strategies: leveraging existing networks and harnessing virality.

When I was at PayPal, distributing our payment service through eBay was a game-changer. By 2000, eBay had ten million registered users, and we leveraged this by creating software that automatically added a “Pay with PayPal” button to eBay listings. This was a hit despite eBay's own Billpoint service, which sellers had to add manually. Similarly, Airbnb, on advice from Y Combinator’s Michael Seibel, successfully tapped into Craigslist by developing technology to seamlessly repost Airbnb listings to the classifieds site, significantly boosting host earnings. This integration was notable because Craigslist lacked an API, making it a technological marvel focused on innovative distribution rather than product changes. However, leveraging existing networks can backfire. Zynga thrived by integrating with Facebook but had to adapt when Facebook restricted game-related posts. Fortunately, Zynga's founder, Mark Pincus, had built a resilient franchise. In contrast, content farms like Demand Media, which relied on Google's search algorithms for traffic, struggled and failed when Google adjusted its algorithms to sideline what it considered “junk” content.

Despite the inherent risks, utilizing existing networks can be crucial for business models, particularly when these networks act as a “booster rocket” that can later be enhanced with virality or network effects.

“Viral” distribution means existing users of a product bring more users, creating a ripple effect similar to how a virus spreads. This virality can happen naturally or through incentives. After launching LinkedIn, our focus was on enhancing organic virality, such as making it easier for users to invite friends via address book import tools, like connecting LinkedIn to Outlook contacts. Unexpectedly, users began using their LinkedIn profiles as their professional online identity, boosting viral growth when others sought to do the same. At PayPal, combining organic and incentivized virality proved effective, with monetary rewards for referrals helping drive rapid growth. Similarly, Dropbox used organic sharing and storage incentives to expand quickly, learning the importance of user retention through rigorous usability testing and refining the user experience. Virality generally suits free or freemium models, and combining organic and incentivized strategies can be powerful, as evidenced by Facebook's college-by-college rollout. Additionally, high gross margins, especially in high-tech businesses, are crucial for funding growth, since they allow more cash flow for expansion due to minimal costs of goods sold, as seen in software and SaaS companies.

In contrast to low-margin "old economy" businesses like agriculture, retail, and food service, Amazon's success in the typically low-margin retail industry is noteworthy, though it now heavily relies on its high-margin Amazon Web Services (AWS). In 2016, AWS accounted for 150 percent of Amazon’s operating income, highlighting retail losses. Most valuable companies have gross margins exceeding 60 percent, such as Google (61%) and Facebook (87%). Amazon's gross margin was 35 percent, higher than General Electric's 27 percent. High gross margins attract investors because they prefer businesses where higher revenues yield higher profit margins, facilitating easier fundraising and lower capital costs. Blitzscalers like Amazon and Xiaomi often prioritize market share over gross margins, with investors valuing potential gross margins over realized ones. High gross margins make it easier to cover operational costs like customer support and fuel faster growth. Lastly, network effects have been instrumental in transforming the most valuable companies from traditional industrial and consumer firms to tech giants like Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook, driven by the rise of the Internet and global connectivity.

In our highly interconnected world, companies can achieve extraordinary growth and profitability by harnessing network effects. For simplicity, we’ll define network effects in layman's terms in this book.

A product or service benefits from positive network effects when increased usage enhances its value for all users, creating a "demand-side economy of scale" or "positive externality." These effects generate a positive feedback loop, leading to superlinear growth and value creation. This makes it tough for any node (often customers or users, such as those in fax machine or Facebook networks) to switch to an alternative, resulting in "customer lock-in." This phenomenon often leads to "increasing returns to scale," where one product or company dominates the market and reaps the majority of profits. It's no wonder that smart entrepreneurs and investors are keen on network-effects-based start-ups like eBay, Facebook, and Airbnb. To achieve dominance, understanding and designing network effects into business models is crucial. My colleague Simon Rothman, a leading expert on network effects, cautions against merely adding superficial features like profiles. Instead, true blitzscalers study and implement various types of network effects. NYU professor Arun Sundararajan categorizes these into five broad types on his industrial organization of information technology website.

**Direct Network Effects:** Usage directly increases value. (Examples: Facebook, WeChat, WhatsApp)

**Indirect Network Effects:** Usage promotes complementary goods, boosting the original product’s value. (Example: OS adoption like Windows, iOS, or Android encourages third-party app development, enhancing platform value.)

**Two-Sided Network Effects:** Usage by one user group enhances value for another. (Example: Marketplaces like eBay, Uber, Airbnb)

**Local Network Effects:** Usage by a small user subset increases value for connected users. (Example: Metered call carriers allowing “favorites” with unlimited calls.)

**Compatibility and Standards:** One product’s use encourages compatible product use. (Example: Word’s dominance turned its format into the standard, leading to the decline of competitors like WordPerfect.)

Network Effects Produce and Require Aggressive Growth: The importance of network effects means businesses must aggressively grow and adopt their networks. The impact increases superlinearly; at low scales, network effects dampen user adoption. Companies must hit a “tipping point” where supply meets demand for the product to have value. Businesses like Uber subsidize customers to reach this tipping point quickly. During my time at PayPal, we initially offered free credit card payments to attract users. This tactic led to significant losses, forcing us to charge fees eventually, but our loyal customers accepted the change. For free services like Facebook, shaping user expectations can enhance perceived service value, encouraging adoption. Geoffrey Moore’s *Crossing the Chasm* highlights the difficulty tech companies face transitioning from early adopters to the mainstream. Moore suggests focusing on niche markets and using them as beachheads to expand. This strategy is vital for network effects businesses. Designing products valuable to individual users, regardless of network adoption, reshapes the demand curve. LinkedIn profiles, for instance, provided value independent of network size, by serving as online professional identities. Connectivity fuels Network Effects Businesses.

In today's hyper-connected world, the ease of reaching the tipping point for network effects has significantly increased, supporting and sustaining the network effects that drive market dominance. This high connectivity not only fosters network effects but also helps maintain their influence, ensuring lasting market control.

The Internet has significantly reduced the cost of product and service discovery, allowing companies with a competitive edge to rapidly scale through network effects, resulting in winner-take-all markets. Online platforms like Amazon and Google help popular products rise to the top, and the power of distribution has become crucial to reaching a tipping point. In the Networked Age, companies can avoid traditional growth barriers, such as overhead from rapid organizational expansion, by leveraging networks, as Apple did with Foxconn. This scalability allows tech giants like Google to continue growing at high rates and invest in future innovations, effectively moving from one product S-curve to another, like Apple transitioning from music players to smartphones. Network effects, while not universal, are integral to Silicon Valley's success, driven by a culture of business model innovation. Successful entrepreneurs design business models that leverage these effects for rapid growth, as seen with Craigslist. The concept of "blitzscaling" helps startups reach a tipping point faster, but overcoming growth limiters like product/market fit and operational scalability is essential. Product/market fit, a concept emphasized by Marc Andreessen, involves finding a nonobvious market opportunity that companies can dominate. Entrepreneurs are encouraged to use network intelligence to validate their ideas, though true product/market fit is ultimately proven by user adoption. On the other hand, operational scalability is crucial for handling explosive growth, and designing models that address human limitations and logistical challenges can prevent high-class problems from hindering success.

Managing a small founding team of four requires overseeing relationships between six pairs, but increasing the team to six members escalates the number of relationships to fifteen pairs, a 150% rise in complexity. This exponential increase underscores the challenges of operational scalability as team size grows. One solution is to adopt a business model that minimizes the need for a large workforce. For instance, WhatsApp founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton leveraged a freemium model and network effects to grow rapidly with just forty-three employees, achieving a ratio of over ten million users per employee. Another strategy is outsourcing, exemplified by Airbnb's initiative to enhance listing photos through freelance photographers, which evolved from manual efforts by founders to automated management of a global network. Despite these strategies, sustaining long-term success typically necessitates a substantial workforce, though innovative management techniques can help companies navigate this growth. Future discussions will delve into these innovations and how they support scaling operations.

The other major challenge of operational scalability arises from the pressure of expanding the nonhuman infrastructure of a business. No matter how much demand you drum up, it's pointless if your infrastructure can't support it. These limitations can be fatal to a company’s ambitions, as illustrated by the social networks Friendster and Twitter.

Friendster, the first mainstream online social network before Facebook, launched in March 2003, quickly amassing millions of users. Its founder, Jonathan Abrams, even appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! However, the rapid growth overwhelmed Friendster's infrastructure, leading to long load times, which allowed MySpace to eclipse it by 2005. MySpace, however, eventually lost to Facebook. Twitter faced similar struggles with its famous "Fail Whale" error during high-traffic events such as Michael Jackson's death in 2009 and the 2010 World Cup, but managed to rearchitect its systems, overcoming these issues by the 2012 US presidential election. A significant factor behind the recent surge in web company growth has been Amazon Web Services (AWS), which has enabled companies like Dropbox to scale their infrastructure efficiently without building their own.

AWS exemplifies how Amazon has turned operational scalability into a competitive advantage by leveraging "the power of modularity," a concept articulated by Carliss Baldwin and Kim Clark in their book, *Design Rules, Vol 1: The Power of Modularity*. This principle allows Amazon and its customers to create complex products from smaller, standardized components, not just in software but across its business, enhancing flexibility and adaptability. On the hardware side, China plays a similar role, enabling hardware start-ups to rapidly scale by utilizing its manufacturing capabilities. For instance, Nest managed to grow efficiently with only 130 employees by outsourcing manufacturing, leading to its $3 billion acquisition by Google. Conversely, Tesla Motors has faced growth limitations due to its intricate manufacturing process, resulting in slower production rates and long back orders, highlighting the challenge of scaling to meet high demand despite having an award-winning product.

Whether by design or not, rapidly growing companies often follow proven patterns that leverage growth factors and circumvent growth limiters. While these patterns will be detailed further below, it's crucial to recognize that they are principles, not exact recipes. Adopting these patterns alone won't guarantee an innovative business model, but comprehending them equips entrepreneurs with a set of valuable role models.

Not all business models produce massively profitable businesses, despite following proven patterns. For example, open-source software, which emerged during the dot-com era and has significantly impacted the technology stack, exemplifies business model innovation through free, community-created software. It captures a large market, benefits from network effects, and utilizes distributed volunteer contributions, avoiding scalability issues linked to large employee organizations. However, even Red Hat, the most successful open-source business with a $15 billion market cap after two decades, shows that while open source drives engagement, it doesn't generate massive profits. To qualify as a proven pattern, a model must demonstrate that multiple businesses can achieve significant value with it. Therefore, we've compiled a list of such proven patterns to inspire your business model innovations. **PROVEN PATTERN #1: BITS RATHER THAN ATOMS**.

### The Power of Bits, Platforms, and Freemium Models

Google and Facebook exemplify bits-based businesses, focusing on electronic bits rather than physical atoms, which makes it easier for them to serve a global market and achieve large scales. Such businesses benefit from high gross margins due to lower variable costs and can innovate rapidly through continuous iteration. This is illustrated by WhatsApp's small team managing global operations. George Gilder’s 1990 prediction in "Microcosm" about the ascendance of intellectual resources over physical ones was further validated by Marc Andreessen in 2011, highlighting software-driven giants like Amazon, Netflix, and LinkedIn. Platforms have magnified their value exponentially in the Networked Age, achieving immediate global distribution and seamless API-based transactions, thus cementing competitive advantages through network effects. Dominant platforms like iTunes, Amazon, and Apple's iOS ecosystem benefit from high-margin revenues that can be reinvested to enhance their offerings. Additionally, the freemium model, supported by behavioral insights from Dan Ariely’s research, unveils how offering products for free can alter consumer choices significantly, driving widespread adoption and long-term engagement.

The remarkable power of offering free products can drive distribution and virality by helping achieve the critical mass needed to unleash network effects, as illustrated by LinkedIn's strategy with free basic accounts. By reaching a significant user base, even free users can be monetized effectively, as demonstrated by Facebook's lucrative targeted advertising revenue. However, when the advertising model isn't suitable, especially for educational services, the freemium model offers a solution. Coined by venture capitalist Fred Wilson in 2006, freemium emerged from the 1980s shareware concept and utilizes a free version to attract users and a paid version to monetize them. Dropbox exemplifies this by offering 2 GB free storage, converting a fraction of users to paid plans for additional storage. Another successful model is marketplaces, with giants like Google, eBay, Alibaba, and Airbnb. These platforms thrive on two-sided network effects, creating liquidity where buyers and sellers can efficiently connect. Once a marketplace achieves this liquidity, it triggers a positive feedback loop, making it difficult for new entrants to capture market share.

Marketplaces offer significant advantages beyond the obvious network effects. By enabling a liquid market where supply and demand dynamically price transactions, they ensure more efficient pricing and greater value creation through more transactions. Illiquid markets, in contrast, often result in mispricing and reduced sales. A prime example is Google’s AdWords marketplace, which allows anyone to bid on targeted keywords, democratizing access to global distribution for even the smallest businesses. This contrasts with traditional advertising, where large clients pay exorbitant sums for TV ads during prime time, like the Super Bowl. Google’s system favors ads that generate the most paid click-throughs, showing consumers the most relevant ads without the overhead of intermediaries. By dealing in virtually unlimited, low-cost ad space, Google increases its gross margin. The Networked Age has amplified the value of marketplaces, allowing them to tap into a global market without the limitations of physical infrastructure, thereby overcoming traditional growth constraints.

When Salesforce.com introduced its on-demand CRM product, many questioned the viability of the SaaS model, which differed significantly from the traditional permanent license and on-premise software approach. SaaS shifted the payment structure to subscriptions and necessitated 24/7 data center support, affecting cash flow and staffing needs. Despite initial concerns, SaaS like Salesforce.com and Workday thrived due to broader market reach and more efficient distribution compared to older, on-premise models. SaaS’s success extends beyond enterprise software, influencing industries like music and video streaming, exemplified by Spotify, Pandora, Netflix, and Hulu, that benefit from lower overhead and predictable revenue. This predictability allows for substantial long-term investment, as seen with Netflix’s $6 billion content investment. Additionally, digital goods have emerged as profitable ventures within SaaS, such as LINE’s sticker sales and in-game purchases in the video game industry, both of which boast high margins and scalability.

One of the most underrated yet powerful patterns is the news feed, which has significantly contributed to the success of companies like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Slack. Facebook's innovation with the news feed has driven user engagement, advertising revenue, and long-term retention, making it a world-class business despite attracting users initially through network effects. The model's success lies in its ability to monetize users' desire for amusement by strategically targeting advertisements based on their interests and engagement history, unlike other feed-based products like RSS readers. This capability has positioned Facebook's News Feed as a leader in online advertising, second only to Google's AdWords, which benefits from capturing active consumer intent. Even Twitter's continued relevance and massive scale can be attributed to the power of the news feed model, underscoring the impact of business model innovation over mere product or technology changes.

Beneath the established patterns of business model innovation lie fundamental principles that not only help refine these patterns but also pave the way for creating new ones. Although these principles are not business models in their own right, they often drive the technological advancements that make business model innovation possible.

### UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE #1: MOORE’S LAW

Moore’s Law, coined by Intel cofounder Gordon Moore, is the principle that has fundamentally driven the success of Silicon Valley and the global tech industry. Initially stated in 1965, it observed the annual doubling of transistors on a silicon chip, later adjusted to every eighteen months. Though it originally referred to transistor density, Moore’s Law now predicts the doubling of computing power every eighteen months, a growth currently fueled by multicore, multithreaded computing. The ultimate limit of Moore’s Law seems to be human ingenuity rather than physics. This principle has consistently spurred technological innovation and business models, transitioning from gigantic mainframes to personal tech like smartphones. It’s seen similar impacts on network bandwidth, advancing the Web from text to multimedia, and potentially, VR in the future. Visionary entrepreneurs like Reed Hastings of Netflix have not just followed Moore’s Law but anticipated its progression. Despite technological limitations in 1997, Hastings foresaw streaming TV via the Internet, initially leveraging DVDs as a bridge to his ultimate vision.

Hastings realized that movie DVDs, then selling for around $20, were compact and durable—perfect for a movie-rental-by-mail business. Inspired by an assignment from a computer science class, he saw how technological innovation could enable a new business model that differed from Blockbuster's VHS tape rentals. VHS tapes, being bulky and fragile, were impractical for mail rental. Instead, Netflix utilized DVDs to offer a subscription service with unlimited movies for $20 per month, avoiding the late fees dreaded by Blockbuster customers. Although Netflix initially hinged on mailing DVDs, Hastings envisioned streaming as the future. Despite underestimating the timeline of streaming’s viability, advancements in computer power and internet bandwidth eventually made on-demand television feasible, transitioning Netflix into a dominant streaming service by 2012. Today, Netflix is synonymous with online television, creating "binge watching" and leveraging its subscription model to fund original content like *Stranger Things* and *Beasts of No Nation*. Unlike traditional TV, which bets on broadly appealing pilots, Netflix’s personalized on-demand service curates content based on viewer habits, ensuring satisfaction and reducing cancellations. This personalized approach, empowered by Hastings' patience with Moore's Law, transformed Netflix into one of the most successful media companies, proving that with persistence, a revolutionary idea can evolve from an improbable vision into reality.

Blitzscaling companies harness the power of automation because, if feasible, computers outperform humans in speed, cost, and reliability. This advantage is further amplified by Moore’s Law, which states that computing power doubles every eighteen months, contrasting human evolution's sluggish pace. For instance, journalist Jan Vermeulen highlighted a staggering improvement between the 1977 Apple II and the 2014 iPhone 5S, noting a 2,600-fold increase in clock speed and 16,384 times more RAM, all within one human generation. To illustrate further, if human athletic performance had matched this growth, swimming speeds would be unfathomably faster; however, actual records show only a modest 11 percent improvement. This disparity underscores the power of automation, which enhances not only consumer products such as the iPhone but also optimizes internal operations in companies like Amazon and Google, driving productivity and efficiency to unprecedented levels.

### UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE #3: ADAPTATION, NOT OPTIMIZATION

At a higher level of abstraction, successful scale-ups prioritize adaptation over optimization. Unlike the static, giant assembly lines of Detroit automakers dating back to Henry Ford’s Model T, modern Silicon Valley companies like Amazon and Facebook embrace continuous improvement and constant experimentation. Amazon, for instance, didn’t just perfect its retail capabilities, but diversified into new markets like AWS. Similarly, Facebook evolved from a text-based social network on desktops to an image- and video-rich platform on smartphones. This adaptive approach is crucial for achieving product/market fit in rapidly changing environments.

### UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE #4: THE CONTRARIAN PRINCIPLE

My friend Peter Thiel eloquently discusses the power of being contrarian in his book *Zero to One*.

Whenever I interview someone for a job, I like to ask, “What important truth do very few people agree with you on?” This question is deceptively simple, posing both intellectual and psychological challenges. The knowledge taught in schools is commonly agreed upon, and stating an unpopular truth requires courage. Contrarian thinking, often crucial for creating valuable technology companies, gives a significant advantage because it allows a company to achieve critical scale without much competition. Examples like Amazon, Google, and Facebook show that their success stemmed from pursuing dismissed opportunities. Being contrarian means smart people disagree with you; remember Airbnb’s founders, who faced skepticism from investors. This happens because innovation involves unproven ideas. In this book, we provide tools to design and evaluate innovative business models, while cautioning against bad pattern matching, like “Uber for Pets.” Effective pattern matching involves understanding mechanisms of action, such as Airbnb’s large market and viral city-to-city growth. Let’s practice analyzing billion-dollar business models using our principles of business model innovation.

Sure, here's the summarized version in markdown:

---

In CASE #1: LINKEDIN, the professional networking giant successfully navigated a complex landscape to become a leading social platform for career-oriented individuals. Distinguishing itself from other social media, LinkedIn focused heavily on creating value through professional engagement and information sharing. The platform's unique selling proposition lies in its capacity to connect users with potential employers, foster industry-specific content, and provide tools for career development. Remarkably, LinkedIn's approach to monetization—such as premium subscriptions and advertising—has been a pivotal aspect of its growth strategy. This model enabled them to build a robust revenue stream while maintaining the core essence of professional networking. By continually evolving and integrating new features tailored to professional needs, LinkedIn has cemented its status as an indispensable tool in the professional world.

When we launched LinkedIn in 2002, the dot-com bust had left many people considering the consumer Internet industry as dead. Venture capitalists were highly reluctant to fund rapid growth with millions of dollars. However, I saw a significant opportunity and managed to steer LinkedIn through the initial start-up growth phase until we could secure the capital needed to truly blitzscale. This is the story of how we made it happen. Market Size.

LinkedIn's foundational insight was recognizing the Internet's shift from anonymous cyberspace to a platform reflecting real-world identities, necessitating a professional online identity. This idea was then unconventional, but my cofounders and I saw a significant opportunity in targeting “all white-collar professionals.” To raise funds for LinkedIn's growth, we needed to demonstrate an effective distribution strategy, but early investors misunderstood us as a "Friendster for business relationships," which was an inaccurate comparison. Leveraging my PayPal reputation, I managed to secure initial investments, and we bootstrapped by setting up in a friend’s failing startup. Our distribution strategy hinged on organic virality, encouraging users to invite their contacts via email to expand their networks, but this alone wasn't sufficient. We innovated with tools like the email address book importer to boost invitations and notify users when their contacts joined, ultimately growing to one million users and securing further investment from Greylock.

Gross margins were crucial for LinkedIn as our user growth couldn’t match the leading social networks like MySpace or Facebook, which had far more users. We argued our professional users were more valuable and needed to demonstrate significant high-margin revenues. Initially, we tried a freemium subscription model, limiting free users' InMail requests and offering premium upgrades, which made us cash-flow profitable but not compellingly so. The game changer came when we realized companies would pay for access to scan LinkedIn profiles for job candidates. This lead us to offer an enterprise subscription product, proving it could generate significant high-gross-margin revenues and gave us the confidence to blitzscale. LinkedIn's long-term value hinged on network effects, leveraging direct and two-sided effects, and becoming a standard for professional identities. Direct effects came from every new user adding value, while two-sided effects attracted more employers, enhancing LinkedIn's job-hunting utility. This combined with LinkedIn becoming integral to professional identities, created a formidable strategic moat. Achieving product/market fit for our enterprise product was pivotal; we quickly got market feedback by hiring a salesperson, equipped with mock-ups, to engage potential customers who all wanted to buy it.

At LinkedIn, we encountered two major operational scalability challenges during our blitzscaling phase. The first was the need to develop, maintain, and update both a consumer product and an enterprise product simultaneously, since each was essential for the success of the other. This unconventional and inefficient approach required significant effort from our engineering team. The second challenge was the rapid scaling of our salesforce, even as the product they were selling was still under development. This huge task was managed by our CEOs, Dan Nye and later Jeff Weiner, along with their teams. To ease the scaling process, we utilized technology like our "Merlin" tool, which made sales operations more efficient by automating tasks. Merlin helped salespeople by analyzing usage patterns, recommending which companies to contact, detailing their use of LinkedIn, and generating personalized sales decks.

Jeff Bezos’s ambition for Amazon was to exploit the limitless space of digital shelves to create a store where customers could purchase virtually anything. Starting with books, a substantial market with products ideal for e-commerce due to their durability, standard sizes, and wholesale distribution availability, Amazon has successfully diversified into numerous other categories. Today, it almost achieves Bezos’s “everything store” vision, though cars are still an exception. Retail, being a massive market, has enabled Amazon to seize a substantial share, further expanded by the creation of Amazon Web Services (AWS), which supplies much of the Internet’s computing power, bandwidth, and storage, even for giants like Netflix. Amazon innovatively leveraged the Internet as a distribution platform by initiating the first effective affiliate program, Amazon Associates, turning numerous third-party websites into strong distribution channels. Despite struggling with low gross margins—common in the retail industry and exacerbated by Amazon’s commitment to low prices—Amazon remains financially viable, with profitable North American operations, though these are offset by losses in Asia.

Amazon's retail business, despite low gross margins, seems to be part of a long-term strategy geared towards high gross margins. Dominating e-commerce, with 44% of US sales in 2016, Amazon's retail operations are split into traditional retail and a lesser-known marketplace for third-party sellers. The marketplace, where sellers use Amazon's logistics for a fee, resembles high-margin eBay more than low-margin Walmart. Jeff Bezos highlighted that nearly 50% of purchases come from third-party sellers. The retail side might act as a loss leader, contrasted by the high-margin AWS, which in 2016 generated over $3 billion in operating income and captured more than 40% of the cloud infrastructure market. While Amazon's network effects are weaker compared to platforms like Facebook, its "flywheel" model driving economies of scale is effective, though linear compared to the superlinear network effects. AWS benefits significantly from network effects, standardization, and compatibility, bolstering its success. Historically, Amazon has rarely struggled with product/market fit in its core businesses, swiftly achieving hypergrowth. However, it has seen notable failures outside its core, such as the Fire Phone. Operational scalability remains an area where Amazon excels, arguably leading globally.

Jeff Bezos' leadership has allowed Amazon to flourish by empowering leaders like Andy Jassy, CEO of AWS, and Jeff Wilke, global head of consumer business, to manage vast parts of the company, contributing to Amazon's growth to over 541,900 employees by 2017. Initially minimizing infrastructure costs by outsourcing logistics, Amazon transformed into a top infrastructure company, excelling in logistics and computing infrastructure, as demonstrated by AWS. AWS represents Amazon's most profitable segment, helping other companies utilize Amazon’s advanced infrastructure. In logistics, Amazon’s Fulfillment by Amazon services pose a significant competitive threat to entities like UPS and FedEx. With eighty-six massive fulfillment centers and fifty-eight Prime Now hubs, Amazon offers superior same-day delivery and cost-effective shipping solutions. It leverages “sortation” centers that utilize USPS for cheaper shipping, dramatically undercutting UPS and FedEx's prices.

When Google entered the scene, it was seen merely as another search engine among giants like Yahoo! and Lycos, with expectations that even a significant market share would still leave it in the shadows of Yahoo!'s comprehensive portal services. However, people overlooked two crucial aspects. First, Google's innovative AdWords model—a relevance-based, revenue-maximizing, self-service advertising system—enabled it to generate significantly higher revenue per search than its predecessors. Second, as the Internet grew exponentially, the task of finding relevant information became increasingly vital, enhancing the importance of search itself. This growth, coupled with the explosion of online content, led to a massive market. Google strategically expanded this market by harnessing the strength of its business model to monetize key acquisitions such as Android, Google Maps, and YouTube.

Google’s advanced technology is often credited for its success, but its strategic use of distribution channels also played a crucial role in transforming it from "yet another search engine" to "the last search engine," as Peter Thiel described in his 2014 Stanford lecture. Significant partnerships, like the deal to power AOL’s search results, boosted Google’s growth. Further deals, such as the Firefox partnership, acquiring Android, and launching the Chrome browser, maintained its distribution dominance. Additionally, the AdSense program for Web publishers reinforced its AdWords machine. Google's remarkable 61 percent margin in 2016 wasn't a stroke of luck but a result of its innovative AdWords model, which capitalized on user purchase intent rather than just attracting eyeballs. This enabled Google to earn significantly higher margins per unit of traffic. These robust margins allowed Google to make bold investments in products like Android and Chrome, and fund experimental projects like X and Waymo. Although Google’s core search product hasn’t directly leveraged network effects, many of its other major business lines have.

The mobile traffic app Waze exemplifies a direct network effect; it uses each user’s location data to improve traffic accuracy and facilitates easy reporting of incidents like accidents or speed traps, with all data shared publicly. The app’s value increases with more users. In contrast, the Android mobile operating system showcases indirect network effects, where high user adoption motivates developers to create Android apps, attracting even more users to the platform. YouTube illustrates two-sided network effects by connecting video creators and viewers, where more creators draw in more viewers, and vice versa. Google’s G Suite demonstrates the power of compatibility, standards, and local network effects, similar to Microsoft Office. Users sharing Google Docs or Sheets within a project team or school create pressure for wider adoption among colleagues, students, and parents. This practical experience underscores the importance of achieving product/market fit.

Google nailed the product/market fit with its core search and AdWords products, which vastly outperformed competitors. However, it wasn't an overnight success—initially, Google attempted to sell enterprise search appliances and later tried advertising-supported models by running DoubleClick ads, which it eventually acquired. The breakthrough came with refining Overture's advertising auction model, making AdWords a powerful self-service, relevance-driven system. Google's intentional product management, emphasizing bottom-up innovation and high tolerance for failure, led to major successes like Gmail but also notable failures, including Buzz, Wave, and Glass. Financial strength and a willingness to cut losses enable Google to navigate these failures effectively—illustrated by its pivot from Google Video to acquiring YouTube. Contrasted with Apple’s top-down, focused product development, Google's approach incubates many parallel projects, leveraging operational scalability honed through substantial investments in infrastructure. Each company's strategy emphasizes the importance of finding product/market fit swiftly to stay ahead of the competition.

Google has excelled in people scalability too. Though many of Google's people management strategies are intuitive, like using smaller teams for new products and larger ones for scaling existing products, they've made a significant investment in people analytics. This data-driven approach helps pinpoint the perfect number of interviews per candidate (no more than five) and refines recruitment and performance review practices. 

**CASE #4: FACEBOOK Market Size**

Market size was a significant factor that many underestimated regarding Facebook's potential in its early days. Initially perceived as a “social network for college students,” it seemed like a niche product in an unproven category with a narrow audience. However, when I invested in Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg had a much broader and valuable vision: making Facebook the default way people stayed in touch with friends, targeting a vast market. Despite pitching this expansive vision, many investors were skeptical and would later regret it. Facebook excelled at distribution by focusing initially on college campuses, ensuring a critical mass before launching and leveraging existing friend networks to expand. This strategy spurred incredible virality as users naturally invited their offline friends to join. Although Facebook initially lacked an effective revenue model, it became immensely profitable through sponsored posts in the news feed, with advertising sales now constituting about 90% of its revenue and an impressive 87% gross margin. This financial success enabled significant investments in talent, technology, and strategic acquisitions like Instagram, WhatsApp, and future bets like Oculus, solidifying its dominance in both mobile and desktop social networks.

Facebook's success hinges on its mastery of direct and local network effects, boosting its value as more users join, and the difficulty competitors face in prying those users away. Additionally, indirect network effects from platform services like the Graph API and Facebook Connect enhance its ecosystem. Achieving product/market fit from the start, Facebook's rapid expansion was marked by overcoming significant challenges, including the transition from desktop to mobile, which initially lagged due to a slow mobile experience. Zuckerberg's decisive focus on mobile improvements and acquisitions such as Instagram and WhatsApp paid off, with mobile users now making up a significant portion of Facebook's usage and revenue. Advertiser product/market fit was crucial, as Facebook's superior content algorithms and innovative News Feed ads countered conventional wisdom and effectively monetized mobile engagement. Operationally, Facebook's "Move fast and break things" motto drove quick advancements, though it evolved to include stable infrastructure to handle the growing complexity. As the platform developed, a dual emphasis on speed and stability allowed continued rapid innovation. With a solid business model in place, future strategy necessitates continued innovation to sustain growth.
