Stealing from Reid Hoffman's book *Blitzscaling* for this demo highlights the fascinating background of Hoffman, an American internet entrepreneur, venture capitalist, podcaster, and author, born on August 5, 1967. Hoffman co-founded LinkedIn, the professional networking site, and serves as its executive chairman. Additionally, he is the Chairman of Village Global, a venture capital firm, and a co-founder of Inflection AI. Hoffman's early life was marked by his avid interest in tabletop roleplaying games, leading him to work as an editor at Chaosium, a game company in Oakland, California.

Hoffman attended high school at the progressive Putney School in Vermont, where he engaged in farming activities. He graduated from Stanford University in 1990 with a Bachelor of Science in Symbolic Systems and Cognitive Science and was awarded a Marshall Scholarship for graduate study abroad. Subsequently, he earned a Master of Studies (MSt) in philosophy from Wolfson College, Oxford, in 1993. His paternal great-great-great-grandfather was Theophilus Adam Wylie, a Christian Presbyterian minister and Indiana University president pro tempore. Hoffman's uncle, Eric Hoffman, is a writer, illustrating a family history rich in academic and literary achievements.

Hoffman joined Apple Computer in 1994 and worked on the eWorld project, an early initiative to create an online service, which was later acquired by AOL in 1996. Following his stint at Apple, he moved on to Fujitsu. In 1997, he co-founded his first company, SocialNet.com, which aimed to connect people through online dating and shared interests, such as matching golfers looking for partners in their local area.

Reid Hoffman was a member of the board of directors during the founding of PayPal and joined the company full-time as COO in January 2000, after leaving SocialNet. In December 2002, Hoffman co-founded LinkedIn with former colleagues, including Allen Blue, launching the platform on May 5, 2003, as one of the first business-oriented social networks. Peter Thiel, Hoffman's PayPal colleague, invested in LinkedIn, and at the time of its IPO on May 19, 2011, Hoffman's stake was estimated at $2.34 billion. Microsoft proposed to acquire LinkedIn on June 13, 2016, for $26.2 billion in cash, and Hoffman joined Microsoft's board on March 14, 2017.

By late 2022, Hoffman had invested $2.2 million in JusticeText, a platform to aid public defenders by managing video evidence to boost transparency in criminal justice. On March 3, 2023, Hoffman resigned from his board seat at OpenAI to avoid conflicts of interest with his roles in various AI ventures. As of May 2023, he and Greylock Partners invested in at least 37 AI companies, including Tome, a rapidly growing AI-driven productivity software. Hoffman has criticized calls to pause AI development, advocating instead for accelerated progress to solve societal issues, such as improving healthcare and education. Dubbed the "evangelist in chief" for AI, Hoffman has met with global leaders including President Biden and the Pope. In April 2024, he even conducted an interview with an AI deepfake of himself to discuss AI regulation and other topics. Previously a prolific angel investor post-PayPal sale, Hoffman joined Greylock Partners in 2009, solidifying his influence in Silicon Valley.
