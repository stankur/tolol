### There are only two controls.

Left sidebar for finding pages, where you can click on **+** or **-** to expand or collapse pages, if they have sub-pages.

“Detail Level“ slider on top for controlling how summarized the content is. It has **3** levels. The leftmost part of the range is “heavily“ summarized, and the rightmost part is just the original text.

Some pages (*like this one*) would not have **level 1** and **level 2**. Just because I think it is too short in the first place to summarize.

Below this page, I give you some example where the “Detail Level“ sliders actually work. And the examples are from different books.
