A religion, according to Durkheim \[1912\] 1995, 44, is a coherent system of beliefs and rituals regarding sacred entities, which forms a moral community or Church among its adherents. Rodney Stark and William Bainbridge contend that religion provides individuals with something unattainable by other means. Buckser (1995) explores the intricate dynamics of identity and cultural expressions within Greenlandic Inuit societies, emphasizing how modernization and tradition coexist and shape each other. His work highlights the resilience of cultural practices amid external influences, presenting a nuanced narrative of cultural identity's adaptive nature. The scientific study of religion, historically led by anthropologists, sociologists, and psychologists, dates back to pioneers like Tylor, Frazer, Durkheim, and James. Although these fields initially favored evolutionary explanations, contemporary trends are moving away from such perspectives. A modern evolutionary approach to religion must contend with these established traditions and extensive data. Like the historical decline of functionalism in social sciences and multilevel selection theory in biology, reviving the organismic view of groups suggests a return to a modern, theoretically robust, and empirically verifiable functionalism.

To survey the social science literature on religion, it's crucial to start with the dynamic research program by Rodney Stark, William S. Bainbridge, and their colleagues, which integrates sociology, anthropology, history, psychology, and economics (Stark and Bainbridge 1985, 1987, 1997; Stark 1996, 1999; Finke and Stark 1992; Stark and Finke 2000). Their approach uses diverse methods, combining theory and empirical research, to explore religion through the lens of economics and rational choice theory. Stark posits that religious belief involves rational cost-benefit reasoning and interprets elements like prayer and sacrifice as economic exchanges with imagined supernatural agents for unattainable goods. However, Stark's theory could overlook religion's role in coordinating human cooperation, a view championed by functionalist theories such as those of Emile Durkheim. Durkheim's "Elementary Forms of Religious Life" ([1912] 1995) critiques prior theories of animism and naturism, emphasizing that religion offers practical survival benefits by organizing social life and defining group behaviors. He argues that religion's distinction between the sacred and the profane unites moral communities and enhances group harmony through symbolic representation and emotionally intense rituals. While some of Durkheim's ideas appear outdated today, his view of religion as an evolutionary adaptation remains influential, contrary to Stark and other rational choice theorists who criticize functionalism and regard Durkheim's work as obsolete. It’s essential to distinguish Durkheim's general thesis of religion as a group-level adaptation from his specific, historical proposals.

Evans-Pritchard's immersive ethnographic studies of African tribes, such as the Nuer, presented him as a critic of Durkheim's theories, particularly the rigid sacred-profane division and the generalization from totemism. Despite this, he respected Durkheim’s insights into religion's psychological roles and aligned with functionalist views recognizing religion's societal organization role. Victor Turner echoed these sentiments, seeing religious rituals as balancing individual and communal interests. Evans-Pritchard advocated for firsthand social studies for nuanced understanding, a view opposed to methodological individualism. Evolutionary perspectives have revived functionalism, challenging reductionism by emphasizing emergent group's properties. Adaptationism and evolutionary biology underscore the functional dynamics in social sciences. Functionalist hypotheses, albeit complex to test, prove insightful, exemplified by cases like guppies' predator-specific traits. Rational choice theory, productive in its hypothesis generation, can integrate functionalism, suggesting religious groups act as adaptive units, contrary to the byproduct theory. Developments in evolutionary biology and the unified social sciences envisage a robust foundation for functionalism, recognizing group-level adaptations and the intricate nature of human psychology. The concept of organismic groups now gains acceptance, paving a way to reexamine the nature of religion from a functionalist perspective.
