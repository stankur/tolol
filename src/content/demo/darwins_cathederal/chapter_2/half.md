### The View From The Social Sciences

A religion is essentially a cohesive system of beliefs and rituals concerning sacred entities, which forms a moral community known as a Church amongst its followers, as posited by Durkheim \[1912\] 1995, 44. But what do people truly gain from religion? Rodney Stark and William Bainbridge argue that individuals acquire something unattainable through other means.

In his 1995 work, Buckser delves into the complexities of identity and cultural expressions within the context of Greenlandic Inuit societies. He meticulously examines how modernization interacts with tradition, highlighting the constant negotiation individuals undergo to balance multiple identities. Buckser's insightful analysis underscores the resilience of cultural practices amidst external influences, providing a nuanced understanding of how tradition and modernity coexist and shape each other. Through his detailed exploration, Buckser offers a profound narrative that reveals the dynamic and adaptive nature of cultural identity.

The scientific study of religion has often been led by anthropologists, sociologists, and psychologists, dating back to the foundational work of Tylor in 1871, Frazer in 1890, Durkheim in 1912, and James in 1902. Though historically these fields favored evolutionary explanations to varying extents, current trends show a movement away from such perspectives. Nevertheless, substantial data collected over the years offers a rich body of evidence for testing various hypotheses, including those grounded in evolutionary theory. Any modern evolutionary approach to religion must compete with these established traditions, which range from potentially overshadowing the social sciences to merely rediscovering known knowledge or failing completely. The reality is more nuanced, resembling the historical trajectory of functionalism in social sciences, which lost favor mid-twentieth century similarly to the decline of multilevel selection theory in biology. Reviving the organismic view of groups suggests a return to functionalism, albeit in a modern, theoretically robust, and empirically verifiable form.

To survey the social science literature on religion, it's beneficial to start with the current state of the art, notably the dynamic research program led by Rodney Stark, William S. Bainbridge, and their colleagues. Their work admirably combines sociology, anthropology, history, psychology, and economics (Stark and Bainbridge 1985, 1987, 1997; Stark 1996, 1999; Finke and Stark 1992; Stark and Finke 2000). This body of work impresses with its integration of theory and empirical research, employing diverse methods from ethnographies of modern-day cults to extensive survey data and constructing quantitative databases from historical materials. Approaching this comprehensive literature felt much like a person in a rowboat pulling alongside a fleet of battleships!

Stark and his colleagues approach religion through the lens of economics and rational choice theory, suggesting it as an economic exchange between humans and imagined supernatural agents for unattainable goods like rain during a drought or immortality. Stark posits that religious belief is rational as it involves cost-benefit reasoning and asserts that various elements of religious belief and practice, such as prayer and sacrifice, can be understood through these economic exchanges (Stark, 1999). Stark and Bainbridge's 1987 and 1999 works distill their rational choice theory into clear propositions, summarized effectively in the paper's tables. However, Stark's theory misses the crucial role of religion in coordinating human actions to procure goods that require cooperation, reflecting a byproduct or "spandrel" explanation rather than an adaptive one. While rational choice theorists critique functionalism sharply, often with satirical disdain, dismissing it as outdated, this stance may overlook the adaptive functions of religion in social life. To better understand this, we must revisit the functionalist tradition, as suggested by Durkheim.

My principal example of functionalism is Emile Durkheim’s *Elementary Forms of Religious Life* (\[1912\] 1995). Before Durkheim, the main theories of religion were “animism” and “naturism.” Animism posited that spiritual belief stems from dreams where a phantom self ventures out, leading to a belief in spirits that can explain anything, thereby creating a religious framework involving offerings, sacrifices, and prayers. Naturism, on the other hand, attributed religious belief to awe of nature’s forces. Both theories are seen as byproducts of human cognition, potentially costly by misrepresenting the world. Durkheim countered that religion, being so pervasive, had practical benefits; early humans, needing functional beliefs for survival, would discard ineffective ideas. He argued that if religion were purely about understanding the world, it would have failed due to its incomplete representation of the universe, leading humanity to recognize its inefficacy. Thus, religious practices would have rapidly vanished if they didn’t prove helpful, which they evidently did, according to Durkheim.

Since religious belief poorly represents the natural world, its utility, according to Durkheim, lies in organizing social life by defining groups and prescribing member behaviors. Durkheim argued that religion hinges on the distinction between the sacred and the profane, forming unified moral communities, or Churches, through beliefs and practices related to sacred things. This parallels the biological concept of human groups unified by moral systems. Durkheim viewed religion as an evolutionary adaptation enhancing group harmony and coordination, a core thesis of functionalism in social sciences. He posited that social life, reliant on vast symbolism, requires symbols for abstract entities like social groups. Religion acts as this symbolic representation, exemplified by clans identified through totems and sacred practices. These symbolic badges and the sacredness surrounding behaviors help clans function, maintained through emotionally intense religious rituals and gatherings. Some of Durkheim's ideas, such as the necessity of symbolic thought for social contracts like marriage, still resonate today, though others appear outdated. Stark and rational choice theorists critique Durkheim's broad definition of religion, favoring a focus on supernatural agents, and regard his work and functionalism as largely obsolete, quoting E.E. Evans-Pritchard's dismissive view of Durkheim's deification of society. For our purposes, it's crucial to separate Durkheim's general thesis of religion as a group-level adaptation from his specific, sometimes outdated proposals.

Evans-Pritchard, unlike Durkheim, immersed himself among the people he studied, making significant ethnographic contributions on African tribes like the Nuer. While he admired Durkheim’s imaginative and poetic insights into the psychological fundamentals of religion, such as the elimination of self and denial of individuality in favor of a greater community, Evans-Pritchard critiqued the empirical basis of Durkheim’s theories. He argued that the rigid division between the sacred and profane, and the use of Australian totemism to generalize about religion, were flawed. Evans-Pritchard emphasized the importance of studying societies firsthand, suggesting that this would have given theorists like Tylor and Marett a more nuanced understanding. Despite his criticisms, Evans-Pritchard’s work aligned with functionalist views, recognizing the role of religion in organizing social groups, exemplified by his analysis of Nuer religion and societal segmentation. Victor Turner’s work resonated similarly, describing religious rituals as mechanisms to balance communitas and social structure, highlighting how high status should serve community interests rather than personal gain. Rituals play a crucial role in maintaining this balance, as illustrated by scenes of communal abuse and deferment of status in Gabonese king elections, reinforcing internal social controls over individual power.

Njogoni's endurance during his initiation as King, where he endured abuse with a calm demeanor, illustrates the resilience expected of a leader. The passage also reflects the deep-rooted egalitarian spirit in human communities, despite their hierarchical structures. This ritual, as interpreted by Turner, aligns with the notion of human groups unified by moral systems. Meanwhile, functionalism's persistence, despite being sidelined in some social science disciplines, demonstrates its enduring relevance. Its modern reassessment, particularly through philosophers' synthetic views, reveals the necessity of examining functionalism through evolutionary perspectives. Durkheim's holistic approach, emphasizing society's emergent properties beyond individual behaviors, contrasts sharply with methodological individualism. Reductionism, though critiqued, fails to address the holistic nature molded by natural selection—highlighting that parts permit but do not cause the properties of the whole. This concept is applicable to social groups where, according to multilevel selection theory, group dynamics and properties are emergent from yet not reducible to individual actions. Thus, Durkheim's "organicism," seemingly mystical before, rests on robust evolutionary theories today.



Adaptationism is the most pertinent form of holism/functionalism for this book, necessitating a distinction from another form based on complex interactions, exemplified by the properties of water and salt arising from their part interactions rather than functional organization. This complex interaction-based holism ties in with social sciences' emphasis on interconnectedness, as seen in works like Dynamic Functionalism (Faia 1986), focusing on feedback processes and stable equilibria. However, concepts labeled as functionalism that merely reflect complexity should be avoided, restricting functionalism to traits shaped by natural selection. While individual-level adaptations, like the heart's role in circulating blood, are widely accepted as functionalism, complications arise when explaining group properties, especially in human groups, due to the less obvious influence of natural selection and the historical resistance by evolutionary biologists and social scientists to group selection and evolutionary approaches to human behavior.

I strongly believe that functional explanations should be evaluated using the same criteria in both evolutionary biology and the social sciences. The key difference now is the increased likelihood of these criteria being satisfied for the properties of groups, especially human groups. Philosophers and social scientists already accept individual-level functionalism in nonhuman species, so advancements in evolutionary biology naturally pave the way for the return of group-level functionalism in social sciences. A frequent critique of adaptationist and functionalist hypotheses is their perceived difficulty in testing, often labeled as "just-so stories." However, such criticisms often overlook that nonfunctionalist hypotheses are not necessarily easier to test nor can they replace functionalist ones. Adaptationism remains popular in evolutionary biology due to its simplicity in forming initial hypotheses, requiring less effort compared to alternatives like phylogeny or genetics. Testing functionalist hypotheses is challenging but not immune to scientific inquiry. Evolutionary biologists have demonstrated the existence of adaptations in various organisms, including guppies, through multiple robust methods. For example, guppies display different traits based on predator presence in their environments, a phenomenon supported by various forms of evidence such as the argument from design, phenotype-environment correlations, and direct evolutionary observations. As I aim to apply these evolutionary methods to study religion, it's clear that despite the inherent challenges, substantial progress can be made by leveraging descriptive information and natural experiments. Rather than dismissing the difficulty, we should embrace it and utilize proven tools to further our understanding.

Human behavior is typically goal-oriented, with the tools people use being highly functional. For instance, if I lock myself out of my house and use a ladder to enter through an upstairs window, the ladder's function is to help me reach the window. Similarly, locks and keys function to secure my house while allowing me access, even if I sometimes lock myself out. This kind of functionality pervades human life, extending beyond individuals to groups. For example, a business corporation, intricately designed by its executives, aims to maximize profits. The term "corporation," from the Latin word for "body," suggests a functional organization at a level higher than the individual.

Elster (1983) distinguishes between causal and functional explanations in the context of scientific understanding but also differentiates functional explanation from intentional explanation, which complicates discussions with social scientists about functionalism. To clarify, let's consider biology as the foundation of functionalism: a zooplankton species develops a spike as an antipredator adaptation, and another species shows adaptive flexibility by developing the spike only when predators are present. Both scenarios highlight that the function of the spike is predator protection, regardless of the different developmental mechanisms. This concept extends to other species and adaptations, such as guppies and flounders, and their predator-avoidance strategies. The overarching claim is that adaptive flexibility does not alter the functional interpretation of phenotypes. Human intentionality, seen as an elaborate mechanism of environmental assessment, has evolved through natural selection, leading to adaptive phenotypes. Allman (1999) further supports this by showing how even bacteria exhibit brain-like functions, integrating sensory inputs to produce adaptive behaviors, illustrating the evolutionary roots of complex brain functions.

Human brains, much like other brains, transform environmental information into adaptive phenotypes and are unique in processing symbolic information. Elster’s distinction between functional and intentional explanations, such as profit-maximizing business behaviors, oversimplifies this transformation. The Chicago school found that firms optimized profits without conscious forethought, implying an evolutionary selection process, contrary to Elster's stance that only differential survival qualifies as functional. Intentional thought or imitation is one of many proximate mechanisms, making this distinction unnecessary. Elster's view dismisses latent functions, unseen processes underpinning human adaptation, but these exist at individual, group, and cultural levels. Contrary to Elster's focus on conscious intent, evolving understanding shows sophisticated unconscious processes in humans and animals. Group dynamics function similarly, with evident examples in social insects and evolving human parallels. Cultural evolution, as seen with tribes like the Nuer and Dinka or regions in Italy and the US, also demonstrates latent functions driving societal changes without conscious management. Functional differences, often unperceived, can shape entire cultures and their historical trajectories, suggesting a profound, unconscious evolutionary influence in human life.

Our progress so far can be summarized as follows: I began by describing rational choice theory as one of the most vigorous approaches to religion in the social sciences, which appears to reject functionalism in favor of a byproduct theory of religion based on the general human tendency to seek explanations and employ cost-benefit reasoning. Subsequently, I examined the rejected tradition of functionalism, contending that rumors of its death have been greatly exaggerated. Contrary to popular belief, the anthropologists who followed Durkheim did not reject functionalism due to their greater field experience, and the most important objections raised by philosophers and social scientists must be revised based on the evolutionary principles outlined in chapter 1.

The byproduct theory of religion is often viewed as robust, but my critique aims to demonstrate its limitations. However, before delving into criticisms, it’s essential to recognize the rational choice literature's strengths. This theory has facilitated productive research and embodies scientific inquiry by generating many testable hypotheses and passing some of these tests. Rational choice theory can encompass various explanations of religion: one views it as an economic mind's futile effort (a byproduct), and another as providing unique resources through its beliefs and social organization (an adaptation). Although Stark's formal theory adheres to the byproduct approach, broader rational choice literature oscillates between these explanations. Much like how evolutionary theory offers multiple explanations for religion, so does economic theory, which mirrors individual selection theory but also includes theories of groups or 'firms' as adaptive units. The theory's ability to explain diverse concepts of religion is both its strength and its weakness. For real progress, a specific concept must be chosen and examined. I adopt the stance that religious groups act as adaptive units, criticizing the rational choice literature for seeming to reject this notion while implicitly accepting it—similar to the misunderstanding of group selection in evolutionary biology. This issue pervades the rational choice literature, as exemplified by Iannaccone’s article, which contrasts rational choice with alternatives like unreflective action driven by habit, emotions, or cultural constraints.

For decades, scholars have analyzed religion through various lenses, such as socialization, indoctrination, neurosis, and functionalism, but rarely through rational choice. Iannaccone’s work, in contrast, uses rational choice theory to explain how seemingly inefficient religious practices, like distinctive dress and dietary restrictions, serve to create exclusive communities by deterring free-riders. His theory posits that high membership costs ensure that those who join work for the collective good, thus strengthening the church—a view that aligns with Kelly's observation that stricter churches are more vigorous. This perspective challenges traditional functionalism by suggesting that religious structures evolve to maximize utility, much like a firm in economics. Despite Iannaccone’s association with rational choice theory, his work can be seen as modern functionalism, revealing the latent, community-enhancing functions of religious practices. This shifts the burden from explaining individual behaviors to understanding how religious structures adaptively evolve. Durkheim's ideas resonate here, as he saw religious belief as functional and abandoned when it lacks secular utility. Thus, Iannaccone can be viewed as updating Durkheim for the rational choice framework by demonstrating how religion provides tangible benefits rather than merely byproducts of other processes, indicating a need to reconsider the merits of functionalism in light of rational theories.

Functionalism may yet succeed as a research program, thanks to two significant developments in intellectual thought: advancements in evolutionary biology and the unification of the human social sciences. Recent progress in evolutionary biology, such as multilevel selection theory and the integration of ecology, evolution, and behavior, provides a robust foundation for functional explanations. This contrasts with past views on evolution and its dismissal in the study of primitive religion. Simultaneously, the human social sciences, fragmented and inconsistent across disciplines, need to be rebuilt from first principles, aligning with evolutionary biology. Rational choice theory, often overemphasized, must acknowledge the multifaceted nature of human psychology, which is shaped by a myriad of adaptations over millions of years. The once dominant view of the individual as the sole adaptive unit is giving way to a recognition of group-level adaptations. Evolutionary biology's acceptance of adaptation and natural selection at various levels, particularly regarding humans, challenges the social sciences to follow suit. The organismic concept of groups, now gaining acceptance, will be explored further in explaining the nature of religion.
