Chapter 1, "The View from Evolutionary Biology," explores how Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection applies to social groups and religious contexts. Darwin argued that tribes demonstrating traits such as patriotism, fidelity, and cooperation could outcompete others, illustrating group-level natural selection. The chapter examines the history of group thinking in evolutionary biology, noting a shift in the 1960s towards individualism, but recognizes that under certain conditions, groups can evolve as adaptive units, often facilitated by religion. This aligns with functionalist thinking, which interprets objects or organisms as having a purpose. Darwin's theory posits that adaptation involves phenotypic variation, heritability, and fitness consequences, transforming biology by explaining adaptive design. Social groups, however, present a complex case for adaptation, balancing individual and collective needs to ensure both personal freedom and social cohesion. Ultimately, Darwin’s insights underscore the importance of cooperative traits in human evolution and societal development, challenging simplistic views of society as a singular organism.

The evolutionary concept of adaptation often contradicts intuitive group-level expectations, where one might assume bird flocks act cohesively for collective good. Darwin's theory complicates this due to individual survival and reproductive benefits. He proposed natural selection operates at multiple levels, including groups—a concept known as group selection. Groups with altruistic members could outperform less cooperative ones, but among-group selection must outweigh within-group selection. This complexity extends to religious groups, interplaying with genetic and cultural evolution, within-group selection, and nonadaptive aspects. Evolutionary theory doesn’t guarantee universal altruism, often resulting in in-group cohesion and out-group hostility, necessitating extensive scholarly exploration to understand religious groups' evolutionary dynamics. W. D. Hamilton and Robert Trivers proposed theories of kin selection and reciprocal altruism, respectively, challenging the metaphor of society as an organism. This led to a significant shift, with evolutionists focusing on individual fitness, seemingly overlooking group selection's potential benefits. Although initial group selection arguments were naïve, its outright dismissal was a misstep. I've argued, including work with Elliott Sober, for revisiting group-level adaptation. Critics highlight behaviors like bird warning calls as examples of individual benefit masked as altruism, emphasizing the need for careful definitions of groups relevant to traits. Misinterpretations often stem from the "averaging fallacy," confusing individual fitness across groups with within-group selection. Hence, group selection should be evaluated case-by-case, avoiding outdated assumptions that reject or universalize its impact.

In the 1960s, group selection in evolution was deemed irrelevant, favoring mutational changes. Yet, evidence supports that evolution also occurs via social group integration, forming higher-level organisms. Lynn Margulis pioneered this, proposing eukaryotic cells as bacterial symbiotic communities. Such transitions affirm Darwin's group selection idea, viewing organisms as gene collectives facing "selfish gene" exploits. This advances multilevel selection theory, highlighting genetic social behavior's role in evolutionary dynamics. For instance, human societies, like egalitarian hunter-gatherers, enforce norms for cohesion, echoing social insects' group integration. In the Chewong society, food sharing prevents "punen" (misfortune from unmet desires), reinforcing fair distribution and social harmony. Rituals and fears of animal attacks uphold this behavior despite seeming irrational, showing practical functionality. This view suggests that moral systems drive altruistic behavior beyond kinship or reciprocity. Understanding human social evolution thus necessitates a balanced view of innate psychology and cultural evolution, acknowledging moral systems' roles. The scientific inquiry into these evolving dynamics is an ongoing, fascinating journey.

Evolutionary psychologists Cosmides and Tooby contend that the human mind comprises numerous specialized mechanisms designed for distinct survival challenges rather than a single general-purpose organ. Highlighting examples like migratory birds and desert ants, they illustrate how specialized cognitive circuits have evolved to address survival and reproduction issues. Human adaptations also include mental circuits aiding group formation and moral development, visible in experiments like the robber’s cave and social identity theory. These evolved mechanisms support cooperation and norm enforcement essential for small-scale societies, suggesting that religious behaviors stem from complex psychological structures rather than mere cultural constructs. They propose a blend of innate psychological and cultural systems influencing moral behavior. Despite debates on culture’s nature and relationship to genetic evolution, some see it as an independent process or akin to disease organisms altering individuals. Evolutionary psychologists view the mind as cognitive modules triggered by the environment, sometimes overlooking the role of learning and cultural changes. The author compares cognitive processes to the immune system, advocating a broader understanding beyond specialized modules. This insight emphasizes cultural evolution as adaptive and dynamic, contrasting with genetic determinism. Culture evolves through mechanisms like imitation and group cognition, seen in social insects like honeybees. Larger societies, though less egalitarian, may require status differences for functional operation. Evolution, including cultural dynamics, illuminates adaptability in practices like religion, underlining evolution’s role beyond slow genetic changes. Recognizing group cognition and cohesion influenced by moral systems, the text argues that understanding evolution’s impact needs examining practices like religion through evolutionary biology, considering fitness and morality’s intertwining with religious belief. Such a perspective challenges the view of religion as a misguided scientific endeavor, instead proposing it as an adaptive thought mode. The primary goal is to explore religious groups as adaptive units influenced by multilevel natural selection, offering insights into moral systems and supernatural beliefs' roles in group functionality, with table 1.1 summarizing various hypotheses on religion’s adaptive value. This framework, integrating insights from social sciences, underscores the multifaceted nature of religious practices.
