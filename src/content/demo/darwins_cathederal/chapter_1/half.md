## Chapter 1: The View from Evolutionary Biology

Darwin posited that tribes characterized by high levels of traits like patriotism, fidelity, obedience, courage, and sympathy — traits that lead individuals to aid one another and make sacrifices for the common good — would outcompete others, an example of natural selection. Religion has traditionally been used to explain order and purpose at various levels, but Darwin demonstrated that concepts like "purpose" and "order" can arise from natural selection, with a restrictive application often limited to individuals rather than groups. Evolutionary perspectives challenge the notion of society as a single organism, likened to religious or nonevolutionary views. To assess religious groups as organisms, it's vital to question whether any group qualifies as an organism. This chapter discusses the history of group thinking in evolutionary biology, highlighting that while Darwin was clear-sighted, many successors assumed societies evolved as easily as individuals. Starting in the 1960s, strong rejection of group-level adaptation ushered in an age of individualism in evolutionary biology. However, a balanced view now recognizes that groups can evolve into adaptive units under certain conditions, often facilitated by religion, thus positioning religion not as mere theological explanation but as an evolutionary product enabling groups to function adaptively. The concept of adaptation predates Darwin, defined broadly as fitting or suiting one thing to another, illustrated by both human artifacts and organismal traits and behaviors designed to perform specific functions effectively.

Functionalist thinking, which interprets objects or organisms as having a purpose, is effective with purpose-driven items but can be misleading in other contexts. For example, this approach helps discern a neighbor's intentions but leads to folk tales when applied to the moon. Conversely, non-functionalist thinking is useful for predicting the path of purposeless objects like a rolling boulder. Mistaking a predator for a boulder or vice versa can be disastrous. These thinking styles may have evolved as separate cognitive skills due to their contextual utility (Hauser and Carey 1998; Tomasello 1999). Throughout history, functionalist thinking has been applied to social groups. Plato likened society’s classes to the organs of an organism, and religious texts, like Paul’s description of the church (1 Cor. 12), use similar analogies. The Anglican bishop Joseph Butler (\[1726\] 1950, 21) asserted that humans were made for society and mutual happiness, and early social scientists often spoke of societal organisms with group minds (Wegner 1986). However, while society-as-organism metaphors can seem plausible, they can also be misleading. For instance, an organized army can be seen as a single predator, but the class of beggars lacks an organ-like function and might be better explained by individual greed leading to resource inequality. Thus, social groups are a nebulous category regarding adaptation.

Social life fundamentally hinges on balancing individual interests with group welfare. At its core, human cooperation and societal structures are essential to address conflicts between personal desires and collective needs. By fostering mutual trust and utilizing social norms, societies can navigate this dilemma, ensuring both personal freedom and social cohesion. This equilibrium is crucial for achieving sustainable and thriving communities.

Darwin’s theory of adaptations explains adaptive design via phenotypic variation, heritability, and fitness consequences. Phenotypic traits are observable characteristics that vary among individuals in a population. Offspring often resemble their parents due to shared genes and other factors like cultural transmission, making heritability a key component in evolution, defined as the correlation between parent and offspring traits. Fitness refers to an individual's ability to survive and reproduce, influenced by their phenotypic traits. Consequently, fitness-enhancing traits tend to increase over generations. Darwin’s theory radically transformed biology, encapsulated by geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky’s assertion, “Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.” Survival and reproduction define adaptation, imposing limits on evolution. For example, moths with better camouflage survive predation, making their cryptic coloration more common. However, group-level adaptations like predator warnings show different dynamics; vigilant individuals may gather less food or attract predators, reducing their survival compared to their less vigilant peers. This exemplifies how individual and group-level adaptations have distinct evolutionary paths and limitations.

The evolutionary concept of adaptation often clashes with intuitive ideas, particularly at the group level. While one might expect bird flocks to behave as cohesive units with members acting for the collective good, Darwin's theory indicates this is not straightforward due to individual survival and reproduction advantages. Darwin recognized this "fundamental problem of social life" and proposed that natural selection could occur at multiple levels, including groups. He suggested that groups with more altruistic members would outperform less cooperative groups, a concept known as group selection. However, for groups to act as adaptive units, among-group selection must outweigh the opposing within-group selection. This complexity extends to understanding religious groups, which might or might not function as adaptive units. The interplay between genetic and cultural evolution, as well as forces like within-group selection and nonadaptive aspects, further complicates this. While evolutionary theory can provide insights into the development of religions, it emphasizes that group selection does not guarantee universal altruism and often results in in-group cohesion coupled with out-group hostility. This exploration requires extensive scholarly investigation to unravel the evolutionary dynamics of religious groups and their influence on human social organization.

In the mid-1960s, W. D. Hamilton proposed a solution to the problem of altruism that aligned with strict Darwinian principles, suggesting that evolution favors altruism when directed towards relatives, enhancing the survival of shared genes. Robert Trivers later introduced the concept of reciprocal altruism, highlighting a system of delayed self-interest rather than genuine generosity. These ideas diminished the need for the metaphor of society as an organism, a concept traditional social scientists often take for granted. However, evolutionary biologists rejected group selection so vehemently that it seemed heretical to consider society as an organism, instead focusing on individual fitness and actions such as reciprocal exchanges or exploitation. This strong rejection, heralded as a major intellectual shift, overlooked the potential benefits of group selection. Although early arguments for group selection were often naive, the wholesale dismissal was a misstep. I've discussed this extensively, including in collaborative work with Elliott Sober, advocating for re-evaluating and moving past the rejection of group-level adaptation in evolutionary theory.

To address critics of group selection, it's acknowledged that behaviors, such as a bird's warning call, can appear altruistic but actually be individually selfish. For example, a bird's call could serve to indicate to a predator that it has been spotted, thus deflecting danger to less vigilant flock members. This behavior could then be explained by within-group selection, as calling individuals would have higher survival rates than noncallers, contradicting group selection. Conversely, if calling genuinely warns others at the caller's expense —lowering its individual fitness but improving group survival—then calling evolves through group selection. This complex interplay blurs the lines between individual and group selection, especially when fitness is averaged across groups. The concept of "group selection" becomes clearer when groups are precisely defined per trait, such as bird flocks benefiting from warning calls. Misinterpretations leading to the rejection of group selection often stem from the "averaging fallacy," where individual fitness across groups is confused with within-group selection. Recognizing the importance of defining groups relevant to specific traits reveals the role of group selection in evolution, challenging the exclusive focus on individual selection. Thus, while group selection is not omnipresent, its impact should be assessed case by case, avoiding outdated assumptions that either reject or overly universalize group selection.

In the 1960s, the concept of group selection in evolution was dismissed in favor of the belief that evolutionary changes occur exclusively through mutational changes. However, evidence has since accumulated that evolution also occurs through the formation of functionally integrated social groups, effectively becoming higher-level organisms. Lynn Margulis was among the first to propose this, suggesting that eukaryotic cells are symbiotic communities of bacteria. Similar transitions are now thought to have occurred throughout life's history, reaffirming Darwin's idea of group selection. This perspective reveals that single organisms can be seen as social groups of genes coordinating for the collective benefit, but facing exploitation challenges from "selfish genes." This necessitates understanding genetic social behavior to fully grasp evolutionary dynamics. The realization that organisms themselves are social groups has expanded multilevel selection theory. Mechanisms enabling individual organisms to function cohesively can provide insights into social group integration. The distinction between altruism and social control, where the latter evolves to promote group-beneficial behaviors without high individual costs, is critical. This reconsideration of group-level selection applies to human groups, which, as seen in egalitarian hunter-gatherer societies, operate as moral communities enforcing social norms for group cohesion and welfare. This new understanding positions human groups and their moral structures as influential units of selection, echoing the group integration seen in social insects and challenging previous beliefs focused solely on genetic uniformity and reciprocal altruism.

In the Chewong society, food sharing is critical, and desires frequently concern food. If someone isn’t immediately offered food observed being consumed or brought back from the jungle, they enter a state of punen due to the belief that unshared food fosters unfulfilled desires. Eating alone is considered the worst behavior, rooted in the myth of Yinlugen Bud, who taught that proper human behavior rejects eating alone. The Chewong have developed practices to ensure fair food distribution and avoid punen: food is publicly displayed and shared among households, with a ritual involving touching the food and others while stating "punen" to announce forthcoming sharing. Guests arriving during meals are also included. The punen system extends beyond food to scarce non-food items like bamboo or water, which must be equally shared when in short supply. However, this system does not lead to freeloading, as desires must be fulfilled once voiced, and the fear of punen discourages overt asking. Desiring for oneself is seen negatively as it is a personal emotion that undermines social harmony, illustrated when an old woman, Mag, asked for a whetstone and faced disapproval from others.

The calamity faced by someone in a state of punen among the Chewong can manifest as attacks from tigers, snakes, or poisonous millipedes, whose spirit forms can also bring disease or injury. These misfortunes serve as "evidence" of a prior transgression, demonstrating a system immune to disproof. This should not be seen as a weakness but as a strength in regulating behavior within their society. The practices highlighted show altruistic behaviors emerge without a narrow focus on genealogical ties or return gains, instead driven by a moral system that defines right and wrong conduct. This system discourages self-serving behaviors and invites punishment from both animals and community members for wrongdoings. Though it doesn’t work perfectly, it functions well enough to encourage food sharing and social unity. Despite appearing irrational, this belief system has practical functionality, suggesting that dismissing its possible functions would be as foolish as attributing function to every detail. We must strive for a balanced understanding, acknowledging that human social evolution requires viewing moral systems both from an innate psychological perspective and as products of rapid cultural evolution. This exploration offers a dynamic view of scientific inquiry, full of inconsistencies and ongoing discoveries, which makes the process more intriguing than merely knowing the final outcomes.

Evolutionary psychologists Cosmides and Tooby argue that the mind consists of numerous specialized mechanisms tailored to specific survival challenges, as opposed to a single general-purpose organ guided by universal laws like operant conditioning or rational choice. Examples from nature, such as migratory birds using the center of night sky rotation for navigation and desert ants employing solar-based dead reckoning, demonstrate evolved specialized circuits. These cognitive adaptations solve distinct problems of survival and reproduction, specific to each species. Similarly, humans possess specialized mental circuits for group formation and moral system development, as evidenced by key studies like the robber’s cave experiment and social psychology's social identity theory. These mechanisms, evolved through natural selection, automatically facilitate cooperation and norm enforcement, reflecting sophisticated cognitive machinery akin to vision. Understanding these innate systems, essential for small-scale human societies, requires a synthesis of social sciences and evolutionary biology. Consequently, religious behaviors should be viewed as emerging from these complex psychological structures rather than merely cultural inventions.

From an evolutionary perspective, moral systems combine both an innate psychological dimension and an open-ended cultural dimension. While our genetically evolved minds enable the existence of moral systems, the specific contents of these systems can change within and vary widely among groups, impacting survival and reproduction. This insight contradicts the notion of genetic determinism, suggesting instead that our biology fosters cultural evolution. Despite the recognition of culture as an evolutionary process, there remains little consensus on its nature or its relationship with genetic evolution. Critics of sociobiology view culture as independent of biology, while some biologists see it as a quicker, adaptive evolution parallel to genetic evolution. Others, like Dawkins and Blackmore, propose culture impacts individuals like disease organisms. Evolutionary psychologists often present the human mind as a collection of specialized cognitive modules triggered by the environment. This perspective, though insightful, tends to underplay the role of learning, development, and cultural changes as dynamic, open-ended processes. To illustrate this point, the author likens the immune system—a sophisticated, evolved set of mechanisms that relies on an open-ended process of blind variation and selective retention—to cognitive processes, advocating for a broader understanding of human mentality beyond specialized modules.

This comparison between the mind and the immune system reveals that genetic evolution does not always lead to modularity but can produce open-ended, evolutionary processes capable of addressing new problems—termed "Darwin machines" by Plotkin. These processes, tightly managed yet evolutionary, adapt to recent environments and reflect historical contingencies. Viewing the mind as an evolution-driven system akin to the immune system highlights its specialized features and potential for cultural evolution in diverse and changing environments. Unlike deterministic gene selection, cultural evolution operates through mechanisms like trial and error, imitation, and distributed cognition across groups, often beneath conscious awareness. The concept of group cognition, supported by studies of social insects like honeybees, suggests groups can function similarly to a brain, with individuals acting as neurons. Modern human societies, though different from ancient ones, continue to evolve culturally, with multilevel selection promoting group-beneficial traits. This broader perspective on evolution, including cultural dynamics, offers insights into the adaptability and transformative potential of practices such as religion, emphasizing that evolution encompasses more than just slow genetic changes. Cultural evolution thus redefines how we understand historical developments and human adaptability.

Large-scale human societies appear less egalitarian than hunter-gatherer groups, but this inequity can be viewed in two distinct ways. Small groups, where individuals rely on one another, tend to have stronger social control mechanisms, making inequities in larger societies seem like individual-level adaptations that are often detrimental at a societal level. However, from a group-level functional standpoint, societies must diversify as they grow; while thirty people can make consensual decisions easily, thirty million cannot. This raises the question: are extreme status differences simply domination, or necessary design features for functioning at a large scale, particularly in competition with other societies? Although larger societies tend to replace smaller ones unless hampered by coordination issues, cultural evolution may see smaller groups merging into larger ones, akin to long-term biological evolution. Importantly, organismic groups do not evolve automatically but through group selection, which has been a powerful evolutionary force, leading to today's highly integrated social organisms. Human societal organisms depend significantly on moral systems to govern behavior and prevent internal subversion, with these systems having both innate psychological and open-ended dimensions. This framework views human history as a rapid evolutionary process driven by cultural mechanisms. To further explore evolutionary concepts relevant to religion, we must examine fitness and why morality often manifests in the form of religion.

Studying religion and other subjects through an evolutionary lens necessitates a clear definition of fitness, which can be relatively straightforward for physical traits like aerodynamic shapes in birds. However, when it comes to behaviors such as a traveling salesman’s route or a hummingbird’s flower visits, efficiency can be precisely measured too. Historical explanations in Darwin's time focused on the apparent design in nature, striving to explain the evident functionality. At a basic level, fitness seems intuitive, but complications arise due to its relative nature—an organism is only considered fit if it reproduces better than others, sometimes leading to morally questionable behaviors that benefit the individual over the group. For instance, some males kill infants to expedite mating, behaviors that are not beneficial in a broader context, yet increase individual reproductive success. Group selection offers partial solutions, but can escalate between-group conflicts. This relative and local concept of fitness can analogously be seen in cultural systems, like the persistence of the English measurement system over the metric system due to majority effects. Fitness can also be affected by genetic inheritance complexities, as seen in the sickle cell gene’s varying benefits and detriments. Additionally, genes in differing transmission modes, like cytoplasmic versus autosomal inheritance, lead to conflicts that challenge the coherence of an organism. These principles complicate and enrich our understanding of cultural evolution, paralleling the intricate dynamics in religious and social behaviors.

A fifth complication in understanding natural selection involves distinguishing the process from its product. While an adaptation is expected to be well-designed for its environment as a result of natural selection, the actual process involves numerous failures for each success, much like the unappealing creation of laws or sausages. Failed religious experiments, therefore, should not be considered arguments against evolution if we’re observing both process and product. The key question is whether successful religious practices succeed due to their inherent properties and whether these properties are passed on, with modifications, to future religions. Despite these and other complications, it’s crucial not to lose sight of the progress that can be made. Religions often address basic survival and reproductive needs—food, shelter, health, safety, marriage, child development, and social relationships—so fundamentally connected to survival that we need not delve into the nitty-gritty details any more than Darwin needed to question the utility of a thick beak for cracking seeds. It’s often clear whether individuals secure life’s necessities at others' expense or through cooperation. This fundamental problem of social life and religion’s role in addressing it is essential, and I will attempt to show how it stands despite the complexities tied to fitness.

I've discussed evolution, human behavior, morality, and culture but have touched lightly on religion and its role in morality. Why do humans embed moral systems within religious frameworks, invoking supernatural beliefs that seem detached from reality? Religion captures scientists' attention and the scorn of nonbelievers because it appears to defy scientific principles. It’s often suggested that religion is merely an outdated attempt to understand the world. However, this overlooks the fact that all cultures exhibit sophisticated scientific understanding. More importantly, scientific advancements haven't eradicated religious belief, as seen in the continued religiosity and participation in organized religion among scientists. Religion and scientific thought coexist, rather than one being an inferior version of the other. From an evolutionary perspective, knowing how to interpret reality is an adaptive trait, but sometimes distorting reality can also be adaptive. Emotions, far older than logical reasoning, motivate behavior, suggesting that moral systems are designed to trigger emotional responses rather than rely solely on factual evidence. Elements like stories, music, and rituals effectively guide group behavior, and supernatural beliefs provide clear, motivating blueprints for action. These religious elements and scientific thought both play crucial roles in human societies. For illustration, the Mbuti tribe’s decision-making process, led by skilled hunters but decided by consensus, shows how moral judgments are shaped by a combination of factual knowledge and communal values, pleasing the forest as a moral compass.

This passage offers a compelling example of hunter-gatherer egalitarianism, where the collective will supersedes that of the strongest individuals, some of whom might otherwise dominate if not for social controls. The group's decision on where to hunt likely stemmed from practical reasoning based on detailed factual knowledge akin to scientific thought. Interestingly, this rational thought coexisted with a belief in a sentient forest, aligning with the group's welfare. The question arises as to why Mbuti thought veered into this "irrational" territory when discussions could have remained purely pragmatic and rational. The answer lies in viewing these alternative modes of thought as potentially adaptive. Once scientific reasoning is no longer seen as the sole adaptive way of thinking, religious forms of thought can also be considered legitimate adaptations, worthy of study and understanding.

The primary objective of this book is to seriously consider the organismic concept of religious groups as a scientific hypothesis, particularly through the lens of evolutionary biology. This chapter explores the multilevel nature of natural selection, which operates among groups and individuals alike, suggesting that moral systems and supernatural beliefs play pivotal roles in helping human groups function as adaptive units. Despite evolution's complexity and resistance to monolithic explanations, the group selection hypothesis sheds significant light on the adaptive value of religion, advocating for its consideration amidst various competing hypotheses cataloged in table 1.1. These hypotheses vary from seeing religion as a group-level or individual-level adaptation to viewing it as a cultural parasite or byproduct of evolution. Although the group selection hypothesis has historically been overlooked and criticized, it offers valuable insights, likening religious communities to organisms that aim for the ideal of true love and unity. This framework will continuously inform our examination of religion, even as we also incorporate perspectives from the social sciences, acknowledging the diverse and multifaceted nature of religious practices and ideals.
