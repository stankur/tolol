If  I invited you here,  I think you enjoy reading because you think new concepts are interesting. Especially if they enhance your understanding of the world through some particular lens, perhaps business, science, or economics.

My problem with reading is that sometimes I go through a book, and I miss the points that the author is trying to make. So, I just read through the book paragraph by paragraph, and I suddenly realize, how the heck did the author get here. Some people call this “Reading with the eyes, and not the brain“.

Authors have the points they want to make in their mind, but they don’t always convey them explicitly. They try to elaborate, add details here and there. That is perhaps why I think it is easy to get lost. It is easy to read a book front to end, but get very little out of it.

I think it is unfortunate that we could get a glimpse of the minds of brilliant people like **Nikola Tesla** (*My Inventions: The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla*), **Reid Hoffman** (*Blitzscaling: The Lightning-Fast Path to Building Massively Valuable Companies*), **Peter Thiel** (*Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future*), **Daniel kahneman** (*Thinking, Fast and Slow*), but gain very little from that view.

My proposed solution is a tool where you can control how “summarized“ the content you are reading is. If you feel like you forget what is the context that got the author yapping about the small details that you are currently reading, you could pull a slider, and it will summarize the current paragraph, along with its relevant neighbors that are still talking about the same topic.

So, if you get lost in the small details, you have the power to “zoom out“ just a bit. If you are afraid of the cognitively impenetrable wall of text, you can zoom out as much as you want until you feel comfortable.

My solution is probably not perfect. It might even be addressing the problem in the wrong way. That is a valid concern. In fact, I think all the existing solutions are not addressing the problem properly. For instance, Blinkist. No matter how complex, how information dense the book is, it will shrink it down to 15 minutes. You are only presented with two options, either a summary that is way too basic, or a scary wall of text that goes through every small details.

Now go to **demo** in the left sidebar. Sorry that this whole thing is just very scrappy. I feel somewhat embarrassed because it is so buggy, but heck, I’d rather be embarrassed now then spend a significant portion of time addressing things wrongly. So you should be critical about my approach. Saying that the problem is too hard and I should stop is not acceptable, but arguing  possibly better alternatives than what I have in mind, or how my idea could be improved are more than welcome.`,

If I've invited you here, I believe you enjoy reading and find new concepts interesting, especially those that enhance your understanding of fields like business, science, or economics.

My proposed solution is a tool allowing you to control the degree of summarization of the content you're reading. If you lose track of the context amid the small details, a slider can summarize the current paragraph and its relevant neighbors, helping you "zoom out" a bit to reorient yourself. If faced with an overwhelming wall of text, you can zoom out as much as needed until you feel comfortable. While my solution might not be perfect and could be addressing the issue incorrectly, existing tools like Blinkist aren't solving the problem adequately either, as they overly condense content regardless of its complexity.

Criticism and improvements are welcome, but simply dismissing the problem as too difficult isn't helpful.`,

**Paul Graham** ([/ɡræm/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English"); born November 13, 1964)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-DOB_LibCongress-3) is an English-American [computer scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist "Computer scientist"), writer, entrepreneur and investor. His work has included the programming language [Arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_\(programming_language\) "Arc (programming language)"), the startup [Viaweb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viaweb "Viaweb") (later renamed *Yahoo! Store*), co-founding the [startup accelerator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_accelerator "Startup accelerator") and seed capital firm [Y Combinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator "Y Combinator"), his essays, and [Hacker News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_News "Hacker News").

He is the author of the computer programming books *[On Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Lisp "On Lisp")*,[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-onlisp-4) *ANSI Common Lisp*,[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-ansi-5) and *[Hackers & Painters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_%26_Painters "Hackers & Painters")*.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-hackersandpainters-6) Technology journalist [Steven Levy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Levy "Steven Levy") has described Graham as a "hacker philosopher".[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-7)

Graham was born in England, where he and his family have maintained a permanent residence since 2016. He is also a citizen of the United States, where he attended all of his schooling and lived for 48 years prior to returning to England.

## Education and early life

Graham and his family moved to [Pittsburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh "Pittsburgh"), [Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania "Pennsylvania") in 1968, where he later attended [Gateway High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_High_School_\(Pennsylvania\) "Gateway High School (Pennsylvania)"). Graham gained interest in science and mathematics from his father who was a [nuclear physicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_physicist "Nuclear physicist").[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-early_interest-8)

Graham received a [Bachelor of Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts "Bachelor of Arts") with a major in [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy") from [Cornell University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University "Cornell University") in 1986.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-bio-9)[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-10)[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-11) He then received a [Master of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Science "Master of Science") in 1988, and a [Doctor of Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy "Doctor of Philosophy") in 1990, both in [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science") from [Harvard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University "Harvard University").[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-bio-9)[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-SpeakerMix_bio-12)

Graham has also studied painting at the [Rhode Island School of Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island_School_of_Design "Rhode Island School of Design") and at the [Accademia di Belle Arti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accademia_di_Belle_Arti_Firenze "Accademia di Belle Arti Firenze") in [Florence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence "Florence").[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-bio-9)[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-SpeakerMix_bio-12)

## Career\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Career")\]

In 1996, Graham and [Robert Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Tappan_Morris "Robert Tappan Morris") founded [Viaweb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viaweb "Viaweb") and recruited [Trevor Blackwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Blackwell "Trevor Blackwell") shortly after. They believed that Viaweb was the first [application service provider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_service_provider "Application service provider").[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-13) Graham received a patent for webapps based on his work at Viaweb.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-14) Viaweb's software, written mostly in [Common Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp "Common Lisp"), allowed users to make their own [Internet stores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_store "Internet store"). In the summer of 1998, after [Jerry Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Yang "Jerry Yang") received a strong recommendation from [Ali Partovi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Partovi "Ali Partovi"),[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-15) Viaweb was sold to [Yahoo!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo! "Yahoo!") for 455,000 shares of Yahoo! stock, valued at $49.6 million.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-16) After the acquisition, the product became [Yahoo! Store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Store "Yahoo! Store").

Graham later gained notice for his essays, which he posts on his personal website. Essay subjects range from *Beating the Averages*,[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-17) which compares Lisp to other [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language") and introduced the hypothetical programming language *Blub*, to *Why Nerds are Unpopular*,[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-18) a discussion of [nerd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerd "Nerd") life in high school. A collection of his essays has been published as *[Hackers & Painters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_%26_Painters "Hackers & Painters")*[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-hackersandpainters-6) by [O'Reilly Media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Reilly_Media "O'Reilly Media"), which includes a discussion of the growth of Viaweb and the advantages of Lisp to program it.

In 2001, Graham announced that he was working on a new [dialect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect_\(computing\) "Dialect (computing)") of Lisp named [Arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_\(programming_language\) "Arc (programming language)"). It was released on 29 January 2008.[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-19) Over the years since, he has written several essays describing features or goals of the language, and some internal projects at Y Combinator have been written in Arc, including the Hacker News web forum and news aggregator program.

In 2005, after giving a talk at the [Harvard Computer Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Harvard_Computer_Society&action=edit&redlink=1 "Harvard Computer Society (page does not exist)") later published as *How to Start a Startup*, Graham along with [Trevor Blackwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Blackwell "Trevor Blackwell"), [Jessica Livingston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Livingston "Jessica Livingston"), and [Robert Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Tappan_Morris "Robert Tappan Morris") started [Y Combinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator "Y Combinator") to provide [seed funding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_funding "Seed funding") to [startups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company "Startup company"), particularly those started by younger, more technically oriented founders. Y Combinator has invested in more than 1300 startups, including [Reddit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit "Reddit"), [Twitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_\(service\) "Twitch (service)") (formerly [Justin.tv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin.tv "Justin.tv")), [Xobni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xobni "Xobni"), [Dropbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropbox_\(service\) "Dropbox (service)"), [Airbnb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb "Airbnb"), and [Stripe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stripe_\(company\) "Stripe (company)").[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-20)

*[BusinessWeek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BusinessWeek "BusinessWeek")* included Paul Graham in the 2008 edition of its annual feature, *The 25 Most Influential People on the Web*.[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-21)

In response to the proposed [Stop Online Piracy Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act "Stop Online Piracy Act") (SOPA), Graham announced in late 2011 that no representatives of any company supporting it would be invited to Y Combinator's Demo Day events.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-Demo_Day_SOPA_cutoff-22)

In February 2014, Graham stepped down from his day-to-day role at Y Combinator.[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-23)

In October 2019, Graham announced a [specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_specification "Technical specification") for another new dialect of Lisp, written in itself, named Bel.[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_\(programmer\)#cite_note-24)`,

		index: `How to Do Great Work

July 2023

If you collected lists of techniques for doing great work in a lot of different fields, what would the intersection look like? I decided to find out by making it.

Partly my goal was to create a guide that could be used by someone working in any field. But I was also curious about the shape of the intersection. And one thing this exercise shows is that it does have a definite shape; it's not just a point labelled "work hard."

The following recipe assumes you're very ambitious.

The first step is to decide what to work on. The work you choose needs to have three qualities: it has to be something you have a natural aptitude for, that you have a deep interest in, and that offers scope to do great work.

In practice you don't have to worry much about the third criterion. Ambitious people are if anything already too conservative about it. So all you need to do is find something you have an aptitude for and great interest in. \[1\]

That sounds straightforward, but it's often quite difficult. When you're young you don't know what you're good at or what different kinds of work are like. Some kinds of work you end up doing may not even exist yet. So while some people know what they want to do at 14, most have to figure it out.

The way to figure out what to work on is by working. If you're not sure what to work on, guess. But pick something and get going. You'll probably guess wrong some of the time, but that's fine. It's good to know about multiple things; some of the biggest discoveries come from noticing connections between different fields.

Develop a habit of working on your own projects. Don't let "work" mean something other people tell you to do. If you do manage to do great work one day, it will probably be on a project of your own. It may be within some bigger project, but you'll be driving your part of it.

What should your projects be? Whatever seems to you excitingly ambitious. As you grow older and your taste in projects evolves, exciting and important will converge. At 7 it may seem excitingly ambitious to build huge things out of Lego, then at 14 to teach yourself calculus, till at 21 you're starting to explore unanswered questions in physics. But always preserve excitingness.

There's a kind of excited curiosity that's both the engine and the rudder of great work. It will not only drive you, but if you let it have its way, will also show you what to work on.

What are you excessively curious about — curious to a degree that would bore most other people? That's what you're looking for.

Once you've found something you're excessively interested in, the next step is to learn enough about it to get you to one of the frontiers of knowledge. Knowledge expands fractally, and from a distance its edges look smooth, but once you learn enough to get close to one, they turn out to be full of gaps.

The next step is to notice them. This takes some skill, because your brain wants to ignore such gaps in order to make a simpler model of the world. Many discoveries have come from asking questions about things that everyone else took for granted. \[2\]

If the answers seem strange, so much the better. Great work often has a tincture of strangeness. You see this from painting to math. It would be affected to try to manufacture it, but if it appears, embrace it.

Boldly chase outlier ideas, even if other people aren't interested in them — in fact, especially if they aren't. If you're excited about some possibility that everyone else ignores, and you have enough expertise to say precisely what they're all overlooking, that's as good a bet as you'll find. \[3\]

Four steps: choose a field, learn enough to get to the frontier, notice gaps, explore promising ones. This is how practically everyone who's done great work has done it, from painters to physicists.

Steps two and four will require hard work. It may not be possible to prove that you have to work hard to do great things, but the empirical evidence is on the scale of the evidence for mortality. That's why it's essential to work on something you're deeply interested in. Interest will drive you to work harder than mere diligence ever could.

The three most powerful motives are curiosity, delight, and the desire to do something impressive. Sometimes they converge, and that combination is the most powerful of all.

The big prize is to discover a new fractal bud. You notice a crack in the surface of knowledge, pry it open, and there's a whole world inside.

Let's talk a little more about the complicated business of figuring out what to work on. The main reason it's hard is that you can't tell what most kinds of work are like except by doing them. Which means the four steps overlap: you may have to work at something for years before you know how much you like it or how good you are at it. And in the meantime you're not doing, and thus not learning about, most other kinds of work. So in the worst case you choose late based on very incomplete information. \[4\]

The nature of ambition exacerbates this problem. Ambition comes in two forms, one that precedes interest in the subject and one that grows out of it. Most people who do great work have a mix, and the more you have of the former, the harder it will be to decide what to do.

The educational systems in most countries pretend it's easy. They expect you to commit to a field long before you could know what it's really like. And as a result an ambitious person on an optimal trajectory will often read to the system as an instance of breakage.

It would be better if they at least admitted it — if they admitted that the system not only can't do much to help you figure out what to work on, but is designed on the assumption that you'll somehow magically guess as a teenager. They don't tell you, but I will: when it comes to figuring out what to work on, you're on your own. Some people get lucky and do guess correctly, but the rest will find themselves scrambling diagonally across tracks laid down on the assumption that everyone does.

What should you do if you're young and ambitious but don't know what to work on? What you should not do is drift along passively, assuming the problem will solve itself. You need to take action. But there is no systematic procedure you can follow. When you read biographies of people who've done great work, it's remarkable how much luck is involved. They discover what to work on as a result of a chance meeting, or by reading a book they happen to pick up. So you need to make yourself a big target for luck, and the way to do that is to be curious. Try lots of things, meet lots of people, read lots of books, ask lots of questions. \[5\]

When in doubt, optimize for interestingness. Fields change as you learn more about them. What mathematicians do, for example, is very different from what you do in high school math classes. So you need to give different types of work a chance to show you what they're like. But a field should become increasingly interesting as you learn more about it. If it doesn't, it's probably not for you.

Don't worry if you find you're interested in different things than other people. The stranger your tastes in interestingness, the better. Strange tastes are often strong ones, and a strong taste for work means you'll be productive. And you're more likely to find new things if you're looking where few have looked before.

One sign that you're suited for some kind of work is when you like even the parts that other people find tedious or frightening.

But fields aren't people; you don't owe them any loyalty. If in the course of working on one thing you discover another that's more exciting, don't be afraid to switch.

If you're making something for people, make sure it's something they actually want. The best way to do this is to make something you yourself want. Write the story you want to read; build the tool you want to use. Since your friends probably have similar interests, this will also get you your initial audience.

This should follow from the excitingness rule. Obviously the most exciting story to write will be the one you want to read. The reason I mention this case explicitly is that so many people get it wrong. Instead of making what they want, they try to make what some imaginary, more sophisticated audience wants. And once you go down that route, you're lost. \[6\]

There are a lot of forces that will lead you astray when you're trying to figure out what to work on. Pretentiousness, fashion, fear, money, politics, other people's wishes, eminent frauds. But if you stick to what you find genuinely interesting, you'll be proof against all of them. If you're interested, you're not astray.

Following your interests may sound like a rather passive strategy, but in practice it usually means following them past all sorts of obstacles. You usually have to risk rejection and failure. So it does take a good deal of boldness.

But while you need boldness, you don't usually need much planning. In most cases the recipe for doing great work is simply: work hard on excitingly ambitious projects, and something good will come of it. Instead of making a plan and then executing it, you just try to preserve certain invariants.

The trouble with planning is that it only works for achievements you can describe in advance. You can win a gold medal or get rich by deciding to as a child and then tenaciously pursuing that goal, but you can't discover natural selection that way.

I think for most people who want to do great work, the right strategy is not to plan too much. At each stage do whatever seems most interesting and gives you the best options for the future. I call this approach "staying upwind." This is how most people who've done great work seem to have done it.

Even when you've found something exciting to work on, working on it is not always straightforward. There will be times when some new idea makes you leap out of bed in the morning and get straight to work. But there will also be plenty of times when things aren't like that.

You don't just put out your sail and get blown forward by inspiration. There are headwinds and currents and hidden shoals. So there's a technique to working, just as there is to sailing.

For example, while you must work hard, it's possible to work too hard, and if you do that you'll find you get diminishing returns: fatigue will make you stupid, and eventually even damage your health. The point at which work yields diminishing returns depends on the type. Some of the hardest types you might only be able to do for four or five hours a day.

Ideally those hours will be contiguous. To the extent you can, try to arrange your life so you have big blocks of time to work in. You'll shy away from hard tasks if you know you might be interrupted.

It will probably be harder to start working than to keep working. You'll often have to trick yourself to get over that initial threshold. Don't worry about this; it's the nature of work, not a flaw in your character. Work has a sort of activation energy, both per day and per project. And since this threshold is fake in the sense that it's higher than the energy required to keep going, it's ok to tell yourself a lie of corresponding magnitude to get over it.

It's usually a mistake to lie to yourself if you want to do great work, but this is one of the rare cases where it isn't. When I'm reluctant to start work in the morning, I often trick myself by saying "I'll just read over what I've got so far." Five minutes later I've found something that seems mistaken or incomplete, and I'm off.

Similar techniques work for starting new projects. It's ok to lie to yourself about how much work a project will entail, for example. Lots of great things began with someone saying "How hard could it be?"

This is one case where the young have an advantage. They're more optimistic, and even though one of the sources of their optimism is ignorance, in this case ignorance can sometimes beat knowledge.

Try to finish what you start, though, even if it turns out to be more work than you expected. Finishing things is not just an exercise in tidiness or self-discipline. In many projects a lot of the best work happens in what was meant to be the final stage.

Another permissible lie is to exaggerate the importance of what you're working on, at least in your own mind. If that helps you discover something new, it may turn out not to have been a lie after all. \[7\]

Since there are two senses of starting work — per day and per project — there are also two forms of procrastination. Per-project procrastination is far the more dangerous. You put off starting that ambitious project from year to year because the time isn't quite right. When you're procrastinating in units of years, you can get a lot not done. \[8\]

One reason per-project procrastination is so dangerous is that it usually camouflages itself as work. You're not just sitting around doing nothing; you're working industriously on something else. So per-project procrastination doesn't set off the alarms that per-day procrastination does. You're too busy to notice it.

The way to beat it is to stop occasionally and ask yourself: Am I working on what I most want to work on? When you're young it's ok if the answer is sometimes no, but this gets increasingly dangerous as you get older. \[9\]

Great work usually entails spending what would seem to most people an unreasonable amount of time on a problem. You can't think of this time as a cost, or it will seem too high. You have to find the work sufficiently engaging as it's happening.

There may be some jobs where you have to work diligently for years at things you hate before you get to the good part, but this is not how great work happens. Great work happens by focusing consistently on something you're genuinely interested in. When you pause to take stock, you're surprised how far you've come.

The reason we're surprised is that we underestimate the cumulative effect of work. Writing a page a day doesn't sound like much, but if you do it every day you'll write a book a year. That's the key: consistency. People who do great things don't get a lot done every day. They get something done, rather than nothing.

If you do work that compounds, you'll get exponential growth. Most people who do this do it unconsciously, but it's worth stopping to think about. Learning, for example, is an instance of this phenomenon: the more you learn about something, the easier it is to learn more. Growing an audience is another: the more fans you have, the more new fans they'll bring you.

The trouble with exponential growth is that the curve feels flat in the beginning. It isn't; it's still a wonderful exponential curve. But we can't grasp that intuitively, so we underrate exponential growth in its early stages.

Something that grows exponentially can become so valuable that it's worth making an extraordinary effort to get it started. But since we underrate exponential growth early on, this too is mostly done unconsciously: people push through the initial, unrewarding phase of learning something new because they know from experience that learning new things always takes an initial push, or they grow their audience one fan at a time because they have nothing better to do. If people consciously realized they could invest in exponential growth, many more would do it.

Work doesn't just happen when you're trying to. There's a kind of undirected thinking you do when walking or taking a shower or lying in bed that can be very powerful. By letting your mind wander a little, you'll often solve problems you were unable to solve by frontal attack.

You have to be working hard in the normal way to benefit from this phenomenon, though. You can't just walk around daydreaming. The daydreaming has to be interleaved with deliberate work that feeds it questions. \[10\]

Everyone knows to avoid distractions at work, but it's also important to avoid them in the other half of the cycle. When you let your mind wander, it wanders to whatever you care about most at that moment. So avoid the kind of distraction that pushes your work out of the top spot, or you'll waste this valuable type of thinking on the distraction instead. (Exception: Don't avoid love.)

Consciously cultivate your taste in the work done in your field. Until you know which is the best and what makes it so, you don't know what you're aiming for.

And that is what you're aiming for, because if you don't try to be the best, you won't even be good. This observation has been made by so many people in so many different fields that it might be worth thinking about why it's true. It could be because ambition is a phenomenon where almost all the error is in one direction — where almost all the shells that miss the target miss by falling short. Or it could be because ambition to be the best is a qualitatively different thing from ambition to be good. Or maybe being good is simply too vague a standard. Probably all three are true. \[11\]

Fortunately there's a kind of economy of scale here. Though it might seem like you'd be taking on a heavy burden by trying to be the best, in practice you often end up net ahead. It's exciting, and also strangely liberating. It simplifies things. In some ways it's easier to try to be the best than to try merely to be good.

One way to aim high is to try to make something that people will care about in a hundred years. Not because their opinions matter more than your contemporaries', but because something that still seems good in a hundred years is more likely to be genuinely good.

Don't try to work in a distinctive style. Just try to do the best job you can; you won't be able to help doing it in a distinctive way.

Style is doing things in a distinctive way without trying to. Trying to is affectation.

Affectation is in effect to pretend that someone other than you is doing the work. You adopt an impressive but fake persona, and while you're pleased with the impressiveness, the fakeness is what shows in the work. \[12\]

The temptation to be someone else is greatest for the young. They often feel like nobodies. But you never need to worry about that problem, because it's self-solving if you work on sufficiently ambitious projects. If you succeed at an ambitious project, you're not a nobody; you're the person who did it. So just do the work and your identity will take care of itself.

"Avoid affectation" is a useful rule so far as it goes, but how would you express this idea positively? How would you say what to be, instead of what not to be? The best answer is earnest. If you're earnest you avoid not just affectation but a whole set of similar vices.

The core of being earnest is being intellectually honest. We're taught as children to be honest as an unselfish virtue — as a kind of sacrifice. But in fact it's a source of power too. To see new ideas, you need an exceptionally sharp eye for the truth. You're trying to see more truth than others have seen so far. And how can you have a sharp eye for the truth if you're intellectually dishonest?

One way to avoid intellectual dishonesty is to maintain a slight positive pressure in the opposite direction. Be aggressively willing to admit that you're mistaken. Once you've admitted you were mistaken about something, you're free. Till then you have to carry it. \[13\]

Another more subtle component of earnestness is informality. Informality is much more important than its grammatically negative name implies. It's not merely the absence of something. It means focusing on what matters instead of what doesn't.

What formality and affectation have in common is that as well as doing the work, you're trying to seem a certain way as you're doing it. But any energy that goes into how you seem comes out of being good. That's one reason nerds have an advantage in doing great work: they expend little effort on seeming anything. In fact that's basically the definition of a nerd.

Nerds have a kind of innocent boldness that's exactly what you need in doing great work. It's not learned; it's preserved from childhood. So hold onto it. Be the one who puts things out there rather than the one who sits back and offers sophisticated-sounding criticisms of them. "It's easy to criticize" is true in the most literal sense, and the route to great work is never easy.

There may be some jobs where it's an advantage to be cynical and pessimistic, but if you want to do great work it's an advantage to be optimistic, even though that means you'll risk looking like a fool sometimes. There's an old tradition of doing the opposite. The Old Testament says it's better to keep quiet lest you look like a fool. But that's advice for seeming smart. If you actually want to discover new things, it's better to take the risk of telling people your ideas.

Some people are naturally earnest, and with others it takes a conscious effort. Either kind of earnestness will suffice. But I doubt it would be possible to do great work without being earnest. It's so hard to do even if you are. You don't have enough margin for error to accommodate the distortions introduced by being affected, intellectually dishonest, orthodox, fashionable, or cool. \[14\]

Great work is consistent not only with who did it, but with itself. It's usually all of a piece. So if you face a decision in the middle of working on something, ask which choice is more consistent.

You may have to throw things away and redo them. You won't necessarily have to, but you have to be willing to. And that can take some effort; when there's something you need to redo, status quo bias and laziness will combine to keep you in denial about it. To beat this ask: If I'd already made the change, would I want to revert to what I have now?

Have the confidence to cut. Don't keep something that doesn't fit just because you're proud of it, or because it cost you a lot of effort.

Indeed, in some kinds of work it's good to strip whatever you're doing to its essence. The result will be more concentrated; you'll understand it better; and you won't be able to lie to yourself about whether there's anything real there.

Mathematical elegance may sound like a mere metaphor, drawn from the arts. That's what I thought when I first heard the term "elegant" applied to a proof. But now I suspect it's conceptually prior — that the main ingredient in artistic elegance is mathematical elegance. At any rate it's a useful standard well beyond math.

Elegance can be a long-term bet, though. Laborious solutions will often have more prestige in the short term. They cost a lot of effort and they're hard to understand, both of which impress people, at least temporarily.

Whereas some of the very best work will seem like it took comparatively little effort, because it was in a sense already there. It didn't have to be built, just seen. It's a very good sign when it's hard to say whether you're creating something or discovering it.

When you're doing work that could be seen as either creation or discovery, err on the side of discovery. Try thinking of yourself as a mere conduit through which the ideas take their natural shape.

(Strangely enough, one exception is the problem of choosing a problem to work on. This is usually seen as search, but in the best case it's more like creating something. In the best case you create the field in the process of exploring it.)

Similarly, if you're trying to build a powerful tool, make it gratuitously unrestrictive. A powerful tool almost by definition will be used in ways you didn't expect, so err on the side of eliminating restrictions, even if you don't know what the benefit will be.

Great work will often be tool-like in the sense of being something others build on. So it's a good sign if you're creating ideas that others could use, or exposing questions that others could answer. The best ideas have implications in many different areas.

If you express your ideas in the most general form, they'll be truer than you intended.

True by itself is not enough, of course. Great ideas have to be true and new. And it takes a certain amount of ability to see new ideas even once you've learned enough to get to one of the frontiers of knowledge.

In English we give this ability names like originality, creativity, and imagination. And it seems reasonable to give it a separate name, because it does seem to some extent a separate skill. It's possible to have a great deal of ability in other respects — to have a great deal of what's often called "technical ability" — and yet not have much of this.

I've never liked the term "creative process." It seems misleading. Originality isn't a process, but a habit of mind. Original thinkers throw off new ideas about whatever they focus on, like an angle grinder throwing off sparks. They can't help it.

If the thing they're focused on is something they don't understand very well, these new ideas might not be good. One of the most original thinkers I know decided to focus on dating after he got divorced. He knew roughly as much about dating as the average 15 year old, and the results were spectacularly colorful. But to see originality separated from expertise like that made its nature all the more clear.

I don't know if it's possible to cultivate originality, but there are definitely ways to make the most of however much you have. For example, you're much more likely to have original ideas when you're working on something. Original ideas don't come from trying to have original ideas. They come from trying to build or understand something slightly too difficult. \[15\]

Talking or writing about the things you're interested in is a good way to generate new ideas. When you try to put ideas into words, a missing idea creates a sort of vacuum that draws it out of you. Indeed, there's a kind of thinking that can only be done by writing.

Changing your context can help. If you visit a new place, you'll often find you have new ideas there. The journey itself often dislodges them. But you may not have to go far to get this benefit. Sometimes it's enough just to go for a walk. \[16\]

It also helps to travel in topic space. You'll have more new ideas if you explore lots of different topics, partly because it gives the angle grinder more surface area to work on, and partly because analogies are an especially fruitful source of new ideas.

Don't divide your attention evenly between many topics though, or you'll spread yourself too thin. You want to distribute it according to something more like a power law. \[17\] Be professionally curious about a few topics and idly curious about many more.

Curiosity and originality are closely related. Curiosity feeds originality by giving it new things to work on. But the relationship is closer than that. Curiosity is itself a kind of originality; it's roughly to questions what originality is to answers. And since questions at their best are a big component of answers, curiosity at its best is a creative force.

Having new ideas is a strange game, because it usually consists of seeing things that were right under your nose. Once you've seen a new idea, it tends to seem obvious. Why did no one think of this before?

When an idea seems simultaneously novel and obvious, it's probably a good one.

Seeing something obvious sounds easy. And yet empirically having new ideas is hard. What's the source of this apparent contradiction? It's that seeing the new idea usually requires you to change the way you look at the world. We see the world through models that both help and constrain us. When you fix a broken model, new ideas become obvious. But noticing and fixing a broken model is hard. That's how new ideas can be both obvious and yet hard to discover: they're easy to see after you do something hard.

One way to discover broken models is to be stricter than other people. Broken models of the world leave a trail of clues where they bash against reality. Most people don't want to see these clues. It would be an understatement to say that they're attached to their current model; it's what they think in; so they'll tend to ignore the trail of clues left by its breakage, however conspicuous it may seem in retrospect.

To find new ideas you have to seize on signs of breakage instead of looking away. That's what Einstein did. He was able to see the wild implications of Maxwell's equations not so much because he was looking for new ideas as because he was stricter.

The other thing you need is a willingness to break rules. Paradoxical as it sounds, if you want to fix your model of the world, it helps to be the sort of person who's comfortable breaking rules. From the point of view of the old model, which everyone including you initially shares, the new model usually breaks at least implicit rules.

Few understand the degree of rule-breaking required, because new ideas seem much more conservative once they succeed. They seem perfectly reasonable once you're using the new model of the world they brought with them. But they didn't at the time; it took the greater part of a century for the heliocentric model to be generally accepted, even among astronomers, because it felt so wrong.

Indeed, if you think about it, a good new idea has to seem bad to most people, or someone would have already explored it. So what you're looking for is ideas that seem crazy, but the right kind of crazy. How do you recognize these? You can't with certainty. Often ideas that seem bad are bad. But ideas that are the right kind of crazy tend to be exciting; they're rich in implications; whereas ideas that are merely bad tend to be depressing.

There are two ways to be comfortable breaking rules: to enjoy breaking them, and to be indifferent to them. I call these two cases being aggressively and passively independent-minded.

The aggressively independent-minded are the naughty ones. Rules don't merely fail to stop them; breaking rules gives them additional energy. For this sort of person, delight at the sheer audacity of a project sometimes supplies enough activation energy to get it started.

The other way to break rules is not to care about them, or perhaps even to know they exist. This is why novices and outsiders often make new discoveries; their ignorance of a field's assumptions acts as a source of temporary passive independent-mindedness. Aspies also seem to have a kind of immunity to conventional beliefs. Several I know say that this helps them to have new ideas.

Strictness plus rule-breaking sounds like a strange combination. In popular culture they're opposed. But popular culture has a broken model in this respect. It implicitly assumes that issues are trivial ones, and in trivial matters strictness and rule-breaking are opposed. But in questions that really matter, only rule-breakers can be truly strict.

An overlooked idea often doesn't lose till the semifinals. You do see it, subconsciously, but then another part of your subconscious shoots it down because it would be too weird, too risky, too much work, too controversial. This suggests an exciting possibility: if you could turn off such filters, you could see more new ideas.

One way to do that is to ask what would be good ideas for someone else to explore. Then your subconscious won't shoot them down to protect you.

You could also discover overlooked ideas by working in the other direction: by starting from what's obscuring them. Every cherished but mistaken principle is surrounded by a dead zone of valuable ideas that are unexplored because they contradict it.

Religions are collections of cherished but mistaken principles. So anything that can be described either literally or metaphorically as a religion will have valuable unexplored ideas in its shadow. Copernicus and Darwin both made discoveries of this type. \[18\]

What are people in your field religious about, in the sense of being too attached to some principle that might not be as self-evident as they think? What becomes possible if you discard it?

People show much more originality in solving problems than in deciding which problems to solve. Even the smartest can be surprisingly conservative when deciding what to work on. People who'd never dream of being fashionable in any other way get sucked into working on fashionable problems.

One reason people are more conservative when choosing problems than solutions is that problems are bigger bets. A problem could occupy you for years, while exploring a solution might only take days. But even so I think most people are too conservative. They're not merely responding to risk, but to fashion as well. Unfashionable problems are undervalued.

One of the most interesting kinds of unfashionable problem is the problem that people think has been fully explored, but hasn't. Great work often takes something that already exists and shows its latent potential. Durer and Watt both did this. So if you're interested in a field that others think is tapped out, don't let their skepticism deter you. People are often wrong about this.

Working on an unfashionable problem can be very pleasing. There's no hype or hurry. Opportunists and critics are both occupied elsewhere. The existing work often has an old-school solidity. And there's a satisfying sense of economy in cultivating ideas that would otherwise be wasted.

But the most common type of overlooked problem is not explicitly unfashionable in the sense of being out of fashion. It just doesn't seem to matter as much as it actually does. How do you find these? By being self-indulgent — by letting your curiosity have its way, and tuning out, at least temporarily, the little voice in your head that says you should only be working on "important" problems.

You do need to work on important problems, but almost everyone is too conservative about what counts as one. And if there's an important but overlooked problem in your neighborhood, it's probably already on your subconscious radar screen. So try asking yourself: if you were going to take a break from "serious" work to work on something just because it would be really interesting, what would you do? The answer is probably more important than it seems.

Originality in choosing problems seems to matter even more than originality in solving them. That's what distinguishes the people who discover whole new fields. So what might seem to be merely the initial step — deciding what to work on — is in a sense the key to the whole game.

Few grasp this. One of the biggest misconceptions about new ideas is about the ratio of question to answer in their composition. People think big ideas are answers, but often the real insight was in the question.

Part of the reason we underrate questions is the way they're used in schools. In schools they tend to exist only briefly before being answered, like unstable particles. But a really good question can be much more than that. A really good question is a partial discovery. How do new species arise? Is the force that makes objects fall to earth the same as the one that keeps planets in their orbits? By even asking such questions you were already in excitingly novel territory.

Unanswered questions can be uncomfortable things to carry around with you. But the more you're carrying, the greater the chance of noticing a solution — or perhaps even more excitingly, noticing that two unanswered questions are the same.

Sometimes you carry a question for a long time. Great work often comes from returning to a question you first noticed years before — in your childhood, even — and couldn't stop thinking about. People talk a lot about the importance of keeping your youthful dreams alive, but it's just as important to keep your youthful questions alive. \[19\]

This is one of the places where actual expertise differs most from the popular picture of it. In the popular picture, experts are certain. But actually the more puzzled you are, the better, so long as (a) the things you're puzzled about matter, and (b) no one else understands them either.

Think about what's happening at the moment just before a new idea is discovered. Often someone with sufficient expertise is puzzled about something. Which means that originality consists partly of puzzlement — of confusion! You have to be comfortable enough with the world being full of puzzles that you're willing to see them, but not so comfortable that you don't want to solve them. \[20\]

It's a great thing to be rich in unanswered questions. And this is one of those situations where the rich get richer, because the best way to acquire new questions is to try answering existing ones. Questions don't just lead to answers, but also to more questions.

The best questions grow in the answering. You notice a thread protruding from the current paradigm and try pulling on it, and it just gets longer and longer. So don't require a question to be obviously big before you try answering it. You can rarely predict that. It's hard enough even to notice the thread, let alone to predict how much will unravel if you pull on it.

It's better to be promiscuously curious — to pull a little bit on a lot of threads, and see what happens. Big things start small. The initial versions of big things were often just experiments, or side projects, or talks, which then grew into something bigger. So start lots of small things.

Being prolific is underrated. The more different things you try, the greater the chance of discovering something new. Understand, though, that trying lots of things will mean trying lots of things that don't work. You can't have a lot of good ideas without also having a lot of bad ones. \[21\]

Though it sounds more responsible to begin by studying everything that's been done before, you'll learn faster and have more fun by trying stuff. And you'll understand previous work better when you do look at it. So err on the side of starting. Which is easier when starting means starting small; those two ideas fit together like two puzzle pieces.

How do you get from starting small to doing something great? By making successive versions. Great things are almost always made in successive versions. You start with something small and evolve it, and the final version is both cleverer and more ambitious than anything you could have planned.

It's particularly useful to make successive versions when you're making something for people — to get an initial version in front of them quickly, and then evolve it based on their response.

Begin by trying the simplest thing that could possibly work. Surprisingly often, it does. If it doesn't, this will at least get you started.

Don't try to cram too much new stuff into any one version. There are names for doing this with the first version (taking too long to ship) and the second (the second system effect), but these are both merely instances of a more general principle.

An early version of a new project will sometimes be dismissed as a toy. It's a good sign when people do this. That means it has everything a new idea needs except scale, and that tends to follow. \[22\]

The alternative to starting with something small and evolving it is to plan in advance what you're going to do. And planning does usually seem the more responsible choice. It sounds more organized to say "we're going to do x and then y and then z" than "we're going to try x and see what happens." And it is more organized; it just doesn't work as well.

Planning per se isn't good. It's sometimes necessary, but it's a necessary evil — a response to unforgiving conditions. It's something you have to do because you're working with inflexible media, or because you need to coordinate the efforts of a lot of people. If you keep projects small and use flexible media, you don't have to plan as much, and your designs can evolve instead.

Take as much risk as you can afford. In an efficient market, risk is proportionate to reward, so don't look for certainty, but for a bet with high expected value. If you're not failing occasionally, you're probably being too conservative.

Though conservatism is usually associated with the old, it's the young who tend to make this mistake. Inexperience makes them fear risk, but it's when you're young that you can afford the most.

Even a project that fails can be valuable. In the process of working on it, you'll have crossed territory few others have seen, and encountered questions few others have asked. And there's probably no better source of questions than the ones you encounter in trying to do something slightly too hard.

Use the advantages of youth when you have them, and the advantages of age once you have those. The advantages of youth are energy, time, optimism, and freedom. The advantages of age are knowledge, efficiency, money, and power. With effort you can acquire some of the latter when young and keep some of the former when old.

The old also have the advantage of knowing which advantages they have. The young often have them without realizing it. The biggest is probably time. The young have no idea how rich they are in time. The best way to turn this time to advantage is to use it in slightly frivolous ways: to learn about something you don't need to know about, just out of curiosity, or to try building something just because it would be cool, or to become freakishly good at something.

That "slightly" is an important qualification. Spend time lavishly when you're young, but don't simply waste it. There's a big difference between doing something you worry might be a waste of time and doing something you know for sure will be. The former is at least a bet, and possibly a better one than you think. \[23\]

The most subtle advantage of youth, or more precisely of inexperience, is that you're seeing everything with fresh eyes. When your brain embraces an idea for the first time, sometimes the two don't fit together perfectly. Usually the problem is with your brain, but occasionally it's with the idea. A piece of it sticks out awkwardly and jabs you when you think about it. People who are used to the idea have learned to ignore it, but you have the opportunity not to. \[24\]

So when you're learning about something for the first time, pay attention to things that seem wrong or missing. You'll be tempted to ignore them, since there's a 99% chance the problem is with you. And you may have to set aside your misgivings temporarily to keep progressing. But don't forget about them. When you've gotten further into the subject, come back and check if they're still there. If they're still viable in the light of your present knowledge, they probably represent an undiscovered idea.

One of the most valuable kinds of knowledge you get from experience is to know what you don't have to worry about. The young know all the things that could matter, but not their relative importance. So they worry equally about everything, when they should worry much more about a few things and hardly at all about the rest.

But what you don't know is only half the problem with inexperience. The other half is what you do know that ain't so. You arrive at adulthood with your head full of nonsense — bad habits you've acquired and false things you've been taught — and you won't be able to do great work till you clear away at least the nonsense in the way of whatever type of work you want to do.

Much of the nonsense left in your head is left there by schools. We're so used to schools that we unconsciously treat going to school as identical with learning, but in fact schools have all sorts of strange qualities that warp our ideas about learning and thinking.

For example, schools induce passivity. Since you were a small child, there was an authority at the front of the class telling all of you what you had to learn and then measuring whether you did. But neither classes nor tests are intrinsic to learning; they're just artifacts of the way schools are usually designed.

The sooner you overcome this passivity, the better. If you're still in school, try thinking of your education as your project, and your teachers as working for you rather than vice versa. That may seem a stretch, but it's not merely some weird thought experiment. It's the truth, economically, and in the best case it's the truth intellectually as well. The best teachers don't want to be your bosses. They'd prefer it if you pushed ahead, using them as a source of advice, rather than being pulled by them through the material.

Schools also give you a misleading impression of what work is like. In school they tell you what the problems are, and they're almost always soluble using no more than you've been taught so far. In real life you have to figure out what the problems are, and you often don't know if they're soluble at all.

But perhaps the worst thing schools do to you is train you to win by hacking the test. You can't do great work by doing that. You can't trick God. So stop looking for that kind of shortcut. The way to beat the system is to focus on problems and solutions that others have overlooked, not to skimp on the work itself.

Don't think of yourself as dependent on some gatekeeper giving you a "big break." Even if this were true, the best way to get it would be to focus on doing good work rather than chasing influential people.

And don't take rejection by committees to heart. The qualities that impress admissions officers and prize committees are quite different from those required to do great work. The decisions of selection committees are only meaningful to the extent that they're part of a feedback loop, and very few are.

People new to a field will often copy existing work. There's nothing inherently bad about that. There's no better way to learn how something works than by trying to reproduce it. Nor does copying necessarily make your work unoriginal. Originality is the presence of new ideas, not the absence of old ones.

There's a good way to copy and a bad way. If you're going to copy something, do it openly instead of furtively, or worse still, unconsciously. This is what's meant by the famously misattributed phrase "Great artists steal." The really dangerous kind of copying, the kind that gives copying a bad name, is the kind that's done without realizing it, because you're nothing more than a train running on tracks laid down by someone else. But at the other extreme, copying can be a sign of superiority rather than subordination. \[25\]

In many fields it's almost inevitable that your early work will be in some sense based on other people's. Projects rarely arise in a vacuum. They're usually a reaction to previous work. When you're first starting out, you don't have any previous work; if you're going to react to something, it has to be someone else's. Once you're established, you can react to your own. But while the former gets called derivative and the latter doesn't, structurally the two cases are more similar than they seem.

Oddly enough, the very novelty of the most novel ideas sometimes makes them seem at first to be more derivative than they are. New discoveries often have to be conceived initially as variations of existing things, even by their discoverers, because there isn't yet the conceptual vocabulary to express them.

There are definitely some dangers to copying, though. One is that you'll tend to copy old things — things that were in their day at the frontier of knowledge, but no longer are.

And when you do copy something, don't copy every feature of it. Some will make you ridiculous if you do. Don't copy the manner of an eminent 50 year old professor if you're 18, for example, or the idiom of a Renaissance poem hundreds of years later.

Some of the features of things you admire are flaws they succeeded despite. Indeed, the features that are easiest to imitate are the most likely to be the flaws.

This is particularly true for behavior. Some talented people are jerks, and this sometimes makes it seem to the inexperienced that being a jerk is part of being talented. It isn't; being talented is merely how they get away with it.

One of the most powerful kinds of copying is to copy something from one field into another. History is so full of chance discoveries of this type that it's probably worth giving chance a hand by deliberately learning about other kinds of work. You can take ideas from quite distant fields if you let them be metaphors.

Negative examples can be as inspiring as positive ones. In fact you can sometimes learn more from things done badly than from things done well; sometimes it only becomes clear what's needed when it's missing.

If a lot of the best people in your field are collected in one place, it's usually a good idea to visit for a while. It will increase your ambition, and also, by showing you that these people are human, increase your self-confidence. \[26\]

If you're earnest you'll probably get a warmer welcome than you might expect. Most people who are very good at something are happy to talk about it with anyone who's genuinely interested. If they're really good at their work, then they probably have a hobbyist's interest in it, and hobbyists always want to talk about their hobbies.

It may take some effort to find the people who are really good, though. Doing great work has such prestige that in some places, particularly universities, there's a polite fiction that everyone is engaged in it. And that is far from true. People within universities can't say so openly, but the quality of the work being done in different departments varies immensely. Some departments have people doing great work; others have in the past; others never have.

Seek out the best colleagues. There are a lot of projects that can't be done alone, and even if you're working on one that can be, it's good to have other people to encourage you and to bounce ideas off.

Colleagues don't just affect your work, though; they also affect you. So work with people you want to become like, because you will.

Quality is more important than quantity in colleagues. It's better to have one or two great ones than a building full of pretty good ones. In fact it's not merely better, but necessary, judging from history: the degree to which great work happens in clusters suggests that one's colleagues often make the difference between doing great work and not.

How do you know when you have sufficiently good colleagues? In my experience, when you do, you know. Which means if you're unsure, you probably don't. But it may be possible to give a more concrete answer than that. Here's an attempt: sufficiently good colleagues offer surprising insights. They can see and do things that you can't. So if you have a handful of colleagues good enough to keep you on your toes in this sense, you're probably over the threshold.

Most of us can benefit from collaborating with colleagues, but some projects require people on a larger scale, and starting one of those is not for everyone. If you want to run a project like that, you'll have to become a manager, and managing well takes aptitude and interest like any other kind of work. If you don't have them, there is no middle path: you must either force yourself to learn management as a second language, or avoid such projects. \[27\]

Husband your morale. It's the basis of everything when you're working on ambitious projects. You have to nurture and protect it like a living organism.

Morale starts with your view of life. You're more likely to do great work if you're an optimist, and more likely to if you think of yourself as lucky than if you think of yourself as a victim.

Indeed, work can to some extent protect you from your problems. If you choose work that's pure, its very difficulties will serve as a refuge from the difficulties of everyday life. If this is escapism, it's a very productive form of it, and one that has been used by some of the greatest minds in history.

Morale compounds via work: high morale helps you do good work, which increases your morale and helps you do even better work. But this cycle also operates in the other direction: if you're not doing good work, that can demoralize you and make it even harder to. Since it matters so much for this cycle to be running in the right direction, it can be a good idea to switch to easier work when you're stuck, just so you start to get something done.

One of the biggest mistakes ambitious people make is to allow setbacks to destroy their morale all at once, like a balloon bursting. You can inoculate yourself against this by explicitly considering setbacks a part of your process. Solving hard problems always involves some backtracking.

Doing great work is a depth-first search whose root node is the desire to. So "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again" isn't quite right. It should be: If at first you don't succeed, either try again, or backtrack and then try again.

"Never give up" is also not quite right. Obviously there are times when it's the right choice to eject. A more precise version would be: Never let setbacks panic you into backtracking more than you need to. Corollary: Never abandon the root node.

It's not necessarily a bad sign if work is a struggle, any more than it's a bad sign to be out of breath while running. It depends how fast you're running. So learn to distinguish good pain from bad. Good pain is a sign of effort; bad pain is a sign of damage.

An audience is a critical component of morale. If you're a scholar, your audience may be your peers; in the arts, it may be an audience in the traditional sense. Either way it doesn't need to be big. The value of an audience doesn't grow anything like linearly with its size. Which is bad news if you're famous, but good news if you're just starting out, because it means a small but dedicated audience can be enough to sustain you. If a handful of people genuinely love what you're doing, that's enough.

To the extent you can, avoid letting intermediaries come between you and your audience. In some types of work this is inevitable, but it's so liberating to escape it that you might be better off switching to an adjacent type if that will let you go direct. \[28\]

The people you spend time with will also have a big effect on your morale. You'll find there are some who increase your energy and others who decrease it, and the effect someone has is not always what you'd expect. Seek out the people who increase your energy and avoid those who decrease it. Though of course if there's someone you need to take care of, that takes precedence.

Don't marry someone who doesn't understand that you need to work, or sees your work as competition for your attention. If you're ambitious, you need to work; it's almost like a medical condition; so someone who won't let you work either doesn't understand you, or does and doesn't care.

Ultimately morale is physical. You think with your body, so it's important to take care of it. That means exercising regularly, eating and sleeping well, and avoiding the more dangerous kinds of drugs. Running and walking are particularly good forms of exercise because they're good for thinking. \[29\]

People who do great work are not necessarily happier than everyone else, but they're happier than they'd be if they didn't. In fact, if you're smart and ambitious, it's dangerous not to be productive. People who are smart and ambitious but don't achieve much tend to become bitter.

It's ok to want to impress other people, but choose the right people. The opinion of people you respect is signal. Fame, which is the opinion of a much larger group you might or might not respect, just adds noise.

The prestige of a type of work is at best a trailing indicator and sometimes completely mistaken. If you do anything well enough, you'll make it prestigious. So the question to ask about a type of work is not how much prestige it has, but how well it could be done.

Competition can be an effective motivator, but don't let it choose the problem for you; don't let yourself get drawn into chasing something just because others are. In fact, don't let competitors make you do anything much more specific than work harder.

Curiosity is the best guide. Your curiosity never lies, and it knows more than you do about what's worth paying attention to.

Notice how often that word has come up. If you asked an oracle the secret to doing great work and the oracle replied with a single word, my bet would be on "curiosity."

That doesn't translate directly to advice. It's not enough just to be curious, and you can't command curiosity anyway. But you can nurture it and let it drive you.

Curiosity is the key to all four steps in doing great work: it will choose the field for you, get you to the frontier, cause you to notice the gaps in it, and drive you to explore them. The whole process is a kind of dance with curiosity.

Believe it or not, I tried to make this essay as short as I could. But its length at least means it acts as a filter. If you made it this far, you must be interested in doing great work. And if so you're already further along than you might realize, because the set of people willing to want to is small.

The factors in doing great work are factors in the literal, mathematical sense, and they are: ability, interest, effort, and luck. Luck by definition you can't do anything about, so we can ignore that. And we can assume effort, if you do in fact want to do great work. So the problem boils down to ability and interest. Can you find a kind of work where your ability and interest will combine to yield an explosion of new ideas?

Here there are grounds for optimism. There are so many different ways to do great work, and even more that are still undiscovered. Out of all those different types of work, the one you're most suited for is probably a pretty close match. Probably a comically close match. It's just a question of finding it, and how far into it your ability and interest can take you. And you can only answer that by trying.

Many more people could try to do great work than do. What holds them back is a combination of modesty and fear. It seems presumptuous to try to be Newton or Shakespeare. It also seems hard; surely if you tried something like that, you'd fail. Presumably the calculation is rarely explicit. Few people consciously decide not to try to do great work. But that's what's going on subconsciously; they shy away from the question.

So I'm going to pull a sneaky trick on you. Do you want to do great work, or not? Now you have to decide consciously. Sorry about that. I wouldn't have done it to a general audience. But we already know you're interested.

Don't worry about being presumptuous. You don't have to tell anyone. And if it's too hard and you fail, so what? Lots of people have worse problems than that. In fact you'll be lucky if it's the worst problem you have.

Yes, you'll have to work hard. But again, lots of people have to work hard. And if you're working on something you find very interesting, which you necessarily will if you're on the right path, the work will probably feel less burdensome than a lot of your peers'.

The discoveries are out there, waiting to be made. Why not by you?`,
		half: `If you gathered techniques for doing great work across various fields, what would their commonalities look like? Driven by this curiosity, I decided to create such a guide, usable by anyone, regardless of their field. Through this exercise, I discovered that these common strategies indeed form a definite structure rather than just a vague notion like "work hard." This recipe for great work starts with the assumption that you're highly ambitious. The first step is choosing what to work on. Your chosen work must have three essential traits: it should align with your natural talents, deeply interest you, and provide ample opportunity to produce outstanding work.

You don't need to stress much about determining the third criterion of work. Ambitious individuals are often already quite cautious about this. Instead, focus on finding something you have both an aptitude for and a great interest in, which can be challenging. When you're young, you're unaware of your true strengths or the nature of various careers, particularly those that don't yet exist. While some people have clear ambitions early on, most need to figure it out through experience. If undecided, simply guess and start working on something; trial and error is fine and will help you understand various fields. Cultivate a habit of pursuing your own projects, as the most significant work you'll do will likely be driven by your own ambitions. Your projects should be whatever excites you most. Over time, what's exciting and what’s important will converge, evolving from simple interests to more complex inquiries. Preserve your enthusiasm and curiosity, as these will guide you toward the right projects. Your excessive curiosity — even if it bores others — is the key to discovering your path.

When you’re intensely interested in something, dive deep enough to reach the frontiers of knowledge where gaps and opportunities for discovery lie. Spotting these gaps takes skill, as our brains often overlook them for simplicity. Embrace unconventional ideas and boldly pursue outlier concepts that excite you, even if others ignore them. This process involves four steps: choose a field, learn extensively, notice gaps, and explore promising ones. Hard work is essential and driven by deep interest. The system assumes you'll magically guess your field early, but often, finding your path involves luck and curiosity-driven experimentation. By trying various things, meeting different people, and reading widely, you increase your chances of finding your passion. Optimize for what’s interesting to you, even if your interests seem unusual. Enjoying the tedious parts of a field is a good sign of suitability, but remain flexible and switch paths if you discover something more exciting along the way.

If you're creating something for people, make sure it's something they actually want by making something you, yourself, want. This aligns with the excitingness rule; the most thrilling story to write is the one you want to read. Many falter by aiming to please an imaginary, sophisticated audience instead of themselves. Several distractions—like pretentiousness, fashion, and money—can lead you astray, but genuine interest will keep you on track. This strategy requires boldness and a willingness to face rejection and failure, but not exhaustive planning. Great work often arises from hard work on ambitious projects rather than meticulous planning. Known as "staying upwind," this approach involves doing whatever seems most interesting and offers the best future options at each stage. However, working on something exciting isn't always straightforward; it requires technique and perseverance, much like sailing through headwinds and hidden shoals.

Working too hard can lead to diminishing returns due to fatigue, reducing productivity and potentially harming your health. The optimal work period varies by task, with some requiring only four or five hours of concentrated effort, ideally uninterrupted. Arrange your schedule to allow large blocks of work time to avoid interruptions, which can deter starting hard tasks. Overcoming the initial resistance to begin work often requires psychologically tricking oneself, acknowledging that the mental threshold to start is higher than that to continue. Telling small lies to yourself, such as taking advantage of the "How hard could it be?" mindset, can catalyze project initiation, especially for younger, more optimistic individuals. Finish what you start, as significant progress often materializes in the final stages of a project. Additionally, considering your work exceedingly important can drive motivation and possibly lead to genuine significant discoveries.

There are two types of procrastination: per-day and per-project, with the latter being much more dangerous. Per-project procrastination involves delaying the start of ambitious projects because the timing never feels right, leading to years of inaction. This type of procrastination is particularly insidious because it camouflages itself as productivity; you're not idle, but diligently working on other tasks, and therefore, it doesn’t raise the same alarms as daily procrastination. To combat this, periodically ask yourself if you are working on what you truly want to work on. While it's acceptable for young people to occasionally say no, this becomes increasingly perilous with age. Achieving great work often requires dedicating an exceptional amount of time to a problem, which shouldn't be viewed as a cost but rather enjoyed as a compelling endeavor.

Great work isn't about slogging away at something you hate for years; it's about consistently dedicating yourself to something you're genuinely passionate about. The cumulative effect of consistent work can be astonishing—writing a mere page a day can result in a book a year. The key is consistency. Great achievements are often made by completing small tasks regularly, leading to exponential growth. This growth, though seemingly flat at first, soon accelerates, creating significant value over time. Whether it's learning or building an audience, the more you invest, the more you gain. Often, we underestimate this process and push through early stages unconsciously, realizing later the importance of initial efforts. Additionally, undirected thinking, such as when walking or showering, can spur innovative solutions, but it requires the foundation of deliberate work. Hence, a blend of persistent effort and occasional mind-wandering can lead to remarkable successes.

Avoiding distractions at work is crucial, but it's equally important to avoid distractions during downtime that push your work out of focus. Letting your mind wander should center on what you care about most, except for love. Consciously develop your taste in work within your field; understanding the best and why it's the best will help you aim higher. Many agree that aiming to be the best rather than just good is essential, possibly because ambition often falls short of the target, or because striving for the best is a different, more motivating endeavor. Trying to be the best can be more liberating and simpler than just aiming to be good. Aim to create work that will be valued in a century, as this is a good proxy for genuine quality.

Don't focus on crafting a distinctive style. Simply do your best; your unique style will emerge naturally. When you strive too hard for distinctiveness, it becomes artificial. True style flows effortlessly from your genuine efforts.

Affectation involves adopting a fake persona, often showing in one's work, with the temptation being greater among the young due to feelings of insignificance. However, undertaking ambitious projects inherently solves this by establishing one's identity through achievement. While avoiding affectation is advisable, a more positive approach is to be earnest, which encompasses being intellectually honest and willing to admit mistakes, thereby avoiding similar vices. Earnestness also includes informality, focusing on substance over appearance, a trait often seen in nerds who conserve their energy for real work rather than pretense. Although cynicism and pessimism may be advantageous in some fields, optimism is essential for groundbreaking work, even at the risk of looking foolish. Great work necessitates earnestness, as it aligns consistently with both the creator and itself, often requiring a willingness to redo parts to maintain this consistency. To combat laziness and status quo bias, one should consider if, having made a change, reverting to the previous state would be desirable.

Have the confidence to cut. Don't hold onto something that doesn't fit just because it makes you proud or because you put a ton of effort into it. In fact, in certain types of work, it's beneficial to strip down your project to its core. This will yield a more focused result, enhance your understanding, and prevent self-deception about the authenticity of your work.

Mathematical elegance might initially seem like a metaphor borrowed from the arts, as I once believed when I first encountered the term "elegant" for a proof. However, I've come to think it might actually be foundational — that artistic elegance derives from mathematical elegance. This notion of elegance extends beyond math, serving as a valuable standard in various fields. Elegance can be a long-term investment; while laborious solutions garner short-term prestige due to their complexity and the effort they demand, the finest work often appears effortless because it feels pre-existing, merely needing to be observed rather than constructed. The truest sign of brilliance in any creative endeavor is when it's unclear whether you're inventing something new or simply uncovering it.

When you're involved in work that straddles the line between creation and discovery, lean towards discovery. Adopt the mindset of being a mere conduit through which ideas naturally take shape.

Choosing a problem to work on is often viewed as a search but ideally resembles creating a new field during exploration. When building powerful tools, ensure they are unrestrictively designed, as they are likely to be used in unforeseen ways. Aim to create tools and ideas that others can build upon or answer questions with. The best ideas have wide-ranging implications and should be expressed in the most general form to reveal deeper truths. However, ideas must be both true and new, which requires a certain degree of skill to identify them once you reach the frontiers of knowledge.

In English, we attribute terms like originality, creativity, and imagination to a certain unique ability, which seems reasonable to label separately as it appears to be a distinct skill. One can possess substantial technical ability yet lack this creative flair. Personally, I dislike the term "creative process," as originality seems more of a habitual mindset than a process. Original thinkers continuously generate new ideas on whatever they concentrate on, similar to an angle grinder producing sparks. However, if their focus is on something unfamiliar, the ideas may not be particularly good. For instance, an original thinker I know, post-divorce, shifted his focus to dating, an area he was inexperienced in, resulting in notably colorful outcomes. Observing originality dissociated from expertise highlights its true nature. While it's unclear if originality can be cultivated, there are definite ways to maximize it. You're more likely to have original ideas when engaged in challenging work, as these ideas arise from the efforts to build or understand something complex, not from trying to be original. Discussing or writing about interesting subjects can also spur new thoughts, as attempting to articulate ideas can draw out the missing pieces. Changing your context, such as traveling or even just taking a walk, can help dislodge new ideas. Exploring various topics expands the "angle grinder's" surface area and often yields fruitful analogies, but rather than spreading your attention thinly across many areas, focus deeply on a few and remain idly curious about others. Curiosity nurtures originality by providing new material to work with and is akin to what questions are to originality's answers. Often, generating new ideas means seeing what was always in plain sight, leading to the paradox that once an idea is found, it often seems obvious.

When an idea strikes you as both novel and obvious at the same time, you can bet it's a good one.

Having new ideas is difficult because they often require a shift in perspective, which involves fixing broken models of the world. While our models help us, they also constrain us, making it hard to notice and correct their flaws. Once a broken model is fixed, new ideas become obvious, illustrating why they seem easy yet hard to discover. Being stricter than others can help identify broken models, as they leave clues against reality that most people ignore. Einstein's success in recognizing the implications of Maxwell's equations stemmed from his stricter view. Moreover, a willingness to break rules is essential for creating new models, as truly innovative ideas break implicit rules of old models and appear conservative only after they succeed. The heliocentric model took a century to be accepted because it initially felt wrong. Thus, good new ideas often seem bad initially; what you seek are ideas that are crazy in a way that is exciting and rich in implications. Recognizing them is uncertain since bad ideas can also seem crazy. Comfort with rule-breaking, whether enjoyed or disregarded, is crucial. Aggressively independent-minded people, who derive energy from breaking rules, find delight in the audacity of their projects, which helps them get started.

The other way to break rules is simply not to care about them or even know they exist, which is why novices and outsiders often make new discoveries; their ignorance of a field's assumptions brings a form of passive independent-mindedness. Similarly, people on the autism spectrum (Aspies) seem to possess an immunity to conventional beliefs, aiding them in generating new ideas. While popular culture pits strictness against rule-breaking, this is a flawed perspective, especially in significant matters where only rule-breakers can truly be stringent. Often, overlooked ideas are subconsciously dismissed because they seem too weird, risky, labor-intensive, or controversial. This opens up an intriguing possibility: if you could disable these filters, you'd see more innovative ideas. One way to achieve this is by considering what ideas might be valuable for others to explore, thereby circumventing your subconscious self-censorship.

You can uncover hidden ideas by examining what's obscuring them, particularly by challenging cherished but mistaken principles, which often create a dead zone of unexplored, valuable ideas. Religions exemplify such collections of flawed principles, meaning that anything metaphorically or literally resembling a religion will have untapped potential hidden in its shadow. Notable figures like Copernicus and Darwin made significant discoveries by confronting such prevailing beliefs. Reflect on what your field might be religious about—principles taken as self-evident but which may not be—and consider the possibilities that arise if you discard these assumptions. Interestingly, people show more originality in solving problems than in choosing which problems to tackle, with even the brightest minds often conservatively sticking to fashionable problems rather than exploring uncharted territory.

People tend to be more conservative when choosing problems to tackle rather than solutions because problems can be long-term commitments, occupying years, while solutions might only take days to explore. Yet this conservatism often goes too far, influenced by both risk aversion and fashion trends, undervaluing unfashionable problems. Some of the most rewarding work comes from revisiting problems deemed fully explored but rich with latent potential, as Durer and Watt demonstrated. Working on unfashionable problems can be gratifying, free from hype and scrutiny, and involves developing ideas that would otherwise be wasted. The most overlooked problems, however, aren't necessarily unfashionable but are underrated in importance. Finding such problems requires indulging your curiosity and setting aside the urge to only pursue "important" problems. The key to groundbreaking work lies in the originality of the problems you choose, as this often leads to discovering new fields. The ratio of question to answer in big ideas is misunderstood; the real insight frequently lies in the question itself.

Part of the reason we undervalue questions is their fleeting nature in schools, where they are answered quickly, much like unstable particles. However, truly great questions can be more than this—they are partial discoveries. They propel us into uncharted territory: How do new species arise? Is the force that pulls objects to the Earth the same as the one that keeps planets in orbit? Unanswered questions can be uncomfortable, but carrying them increases the likelihood of finding solutions or recognizing connections between them. Sometimes, these questions linger with us for years, even from childhood, driving significant discoveries. While people often emphasize the importance of maintaining youthful dreams, it's equally crucial to keep our youthful questions alive.

Experts aren't always certain; in fact, being puzzled about important, unexplored questions often leads to originality. Embrace puzzlement and be rich in unanswered questions, as exploring them generates even more inquiries. Rather than demanding grand questions, pull on the threads of curiosity and see what unravels. Small, prolific efforts often lead to big discoveries, though they come with failures. Favor starting small and evolving projects through successive versions, especially when creating for others, rather than over-planning. Take risks, as high rewards come from them, and avoid the conservatism that often accompanies inexperience.

Even a project that fails can hold immense value. Through the process, you get to explore uncharted territory and confront unique questions that others may not have even considered. There's no richer source of questions than those you come across by attempting something that’s just beyond your reach.

Use the advantages of youth—energy, time, optimism, and freedom—and those of age—knowledge, efficiency, money, and power—appropriately as you encounter them in life. While young, take advantage of your abundant time by engaging in slightly frivolous activities, experimenting, and exploring new interests. This approach allows learning through experience and fresh perspectives, sometimes discovering flaws in ideas that others ignore. As you grow older, discern what truly matters and eliminate insignificant concerns, focusing on impactful activities. Schools often foster passivity and limited views of learning, so dynamically engage with education. Rather than copying uncritically, leverage others' ideas openly and adapt them to create meaningful, original work. Recognize that even successful people have flaws and learn vicariously through both positive and negative examples. Embrace cross-field ideas and visit hubs of excellence for inspiration and self-belief. This balanced approach, from youth to age, can enrich your growth and achievements.

If you're genuinely interested, you'll likely receive a warmer welcome than anticipated from experts in any field, as they often enjoy discussing their work with earnest individuals. Outstanding professionals typically have a passionate, hobbyist-like dedication to their work, and finding such colleagues, though sometimes difficult due to the prestige associated with great work, is crucial. Universities, for instance, maintain a polite fiction that everyone produces high-quality work, though the reality varies greatly across departments. Seek out the best colleagues as their influence is crucial; they can offer fresh insights and support that can elevate your own work. Working with excellent colleagues is better than having many decent ones, as seen in historical clusters of greatness. You'll know you have good colleagues when they continuously surprise and challenge you. While everyone can benefit from collaboration, some projects require large-scale teamwork and effective management, which demands specific skills and dedication. If managing isn't your forte, you must either learn it or avoid such projects. Lastly, maintaining your morale is vital when working on ambitious endeavors, so nurture and protect it diligently.

Morale begins with your perspective on life. An optimistic outlook helps you produce great work, and considering yourself fortunate rather than a victim boosts your likelihood of success.

Indeed, work can offer a refuge from your problems. Engaging in pure work's intrinsic difficulties can be a productive form of escapism, as evidenced by some of the greatest minds in history. High morale fosters good work, which in turn boosts morale, creating a positive cycle. Conversely, poor work can demoralize, making the cycle spiral downward. Therefore, when stuck, switching to easier tasks can help maintain productivity and morale. A critical mistake ambitious individuals make is allowing setbacks to shatter their morale. To avoid this, consider setbacks as integral to the process. Tackling hard problems often requires backtracking. Hence, "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again" should be refined to: If at first you don't succeed, either try again or backtrack and then try again.

"Never give up" misses the mark slightly. Sometimes, ejecting is the right move. A more accurate motto would be: Never let setbacks make you backtrack more than necessary. And importantly: Never abandon the root node. Struggling doesn't inherently mean you're off course—think of it like being out of breath while running; it all depends on your speed. So, learn to tell the difference between good pain and bad pain. Good pain signifies effort, while bad pain indicates damage.

An audience is crucial for maintaining morale. Whether you're a scholar sharing your work with peers or an artist performing for an audience in the traditional sense, the size of your audience isn't as important as its quality. This is particularly uplifting for those just starting out since a small, dedicated audience can be immensely sustaining. Even if only a handful of people genuinely love what you do, that's sufficient. Whenever possible, try to bypass intermediaries between you and your audience. While this may not always be achievable in some fields, the liberation of directly connecting with your audience may be worth considering a switch to a related field where direct engagement is feasible. 

\[28\]

The people you spend time with will significantly impact your morale. Some individuals will increase your energy, while others will decrease it, and these effects can often be surprising. Make it a point to seek out those who boost your energy and steer clear of those who sap it. However, if caring for someone is necessary, that responsibility should take precedence.

Don't marry someone who sees your work as competition for your attention. If you're ambitious, working is essential—almost like a medical necessity. If your partner prevents you from working, they either don't understand you or don't care. Remember, morale is physical; you think with your body. Therefore, maintain a healthy lifestyle by exercising regularly, eating and sleeping well, and avoiding dangerous drugs. Running and walking are great forms of exercise because they're good for thinking. Achievers aren't necessarily happier, but they're happier than they'd be if unproductive. Ambitious, intelligent folks who don't achieve can become bitter. It's okay to want to impress others, but focus on those you genuinely respect. Fame, or the approval of a larger, less significant group, is just noise.

The prestige of a type of work is often an afterthought and can sometimes be entirely wrong. If you excel at something, you'll make it prestigious. The essential question is not how prestigious a type of work is, but how well it can be done. While competition can motivate, don't let it dictate your choices; avoid pursuing something merely because others are. Let your curiosity be your guide—it never misleads and inherently knows what's worth your focus. Pursue what genuinely intrigues you, and you'll find your own path to success.

If you asked an oracle the secret to doing great work, my bet would be on "curiosity." Curiosity alone isn’t enough and you can't force it, but you can nurture it. It's essential across all four steps of doing great work: it guides you to a field, drives you to its frontier, highlights gaps, and compels you to explore them. This essay is long, partly to act as a filter; if you're still reading, you’re inherently interested in doing great work. This boils down to ability and interest, with effort assumed and luck disregarded as uncontrollable. Can you find work where your ability and interest spark new ideas? Likely, yes. The key challenge is finding that work and letting curiosity guide you. Many shy away from pursuing greatness, fearing failure and seeming presumptuous. Yet, are you willing to strive for great work? Now you're consciously deciding. Don’t worry about failing or seeming presumptuous; many face worse problems. Aim for greatness, and let curiosity drive you.

Yes, you'll have to work hard. But remember, lots of people have to work hard. If you're pursuing something fascinating, which you naturally will be if you're on the right path, the work will likely feel less burdensome than it does for many of your peers. The discoveries are out there, just waiting to be made. So, why not by you?`,
		quarter: `Driven by curiosity about common strategies for achieving great work across fields, I created a guide applicable to anyone. Central to it is the notion that highly ambitious individuals should choose work aligned with their natural talents, deep interests, and has the potential for outstanding output. Often, discovering your path involves trial and error, propelled by curiosity and self-driven projects. This process involves selecting a field, extensive learning, identifying knowledge gaps, and exploring them. Consistent deep interest fuels hard work, and success often stems from the cumulative effect of consistent small tasks. It's crucial to focus without distractions, allowing occasional mind-wandering for innovation. Cultivate a refined taste in your work, aiming to be the best. Authenticity is vital; true style emerges from genuine efforts rather than affectation. Optimism is essential for groundbreaking work, which requires earnestness, intellectual honesty, and a focus on substance. Great work also demands confidence to discard inauthentic parts and a drive towards elegance, where the finest, most brilliant work feels pre-existing rather than constructed.

When engaging in work that blends creation and discovery, prioritize discovery by viewing yourself as a conduit for ideas to naturally emerge. Rather than merely searching for a problem to solve, consider it an exploration to create entirely new fields. Design powerful tools with flexibility in mind, anticipating unforeseen uses. Strive to generate tools and ideas that others can expand upon or use to answer questions. The most impactful ideas have broad implications and should be articulated in general terms to uncover deeper truths. Importantly, these ideas must be both true and novel, a skill that becomes critical as you approach the boundaries of knowledge.

In English, terms like originality, creativity, and imagination denote a unique ability that seems distinct from technical skills alone. I personally find the term "creative process" inadequate because originality feels more like a habitual mindset. Original thinkers habitually generate fresh ideas in their focus areas, much like sparks from an angle grinder. However, their unfamiliarity with a topic can result in less effective ideas, highlighting originality as separate from expertise. Originality thrives in challenging work environments and often emerges from efforts to build or understand complex subjects, rather than from attempting to be original. Engaging in stimulating discussions, changing your context, and exploring varied topics can also foster originality. Notably, originality often involves recognizing obvious yet overlooked solutions that require challenging existing models. Rule-breaking and independent thinking, seen in historic figures like Einstein, are crucial for creating innovative models. People tend to be more conservative in choosing problems rather than solutions, often missing out on underrated yet significant issues. Groundbreaking work stems from the originality of chosen problems, often leading to new fields of inquiry. Embrace puzzlement and unanswered questions, as they drive discovery. Start small, take risks, and evolve projects through successive versions. Use the advantages of youth, such as energy and optimism, and the advantages of age, like knowledge and efficiency, as they come. Engage dynamically with education and leverage others' ideas to create original work. Successful collaboration and excellent colleagues are invaluable, as seen in historical clusters of greatness. Maintaining morale and an optimistic outlook is vital for ambitious endeavors.uccess.

Work can serve as a productive escape from life's problems, with its intrinsic challenges providing a constructive form of diversion. High morale leads to good work, creating a cyclical boost, whereas poor work can spiral morale downward. To stay productive, switching to easier tasks when stuck can help. Ambitious individuals often make the mistake of letting setbacks demoralize them, but setbacks are part of the process. The adage "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again" should be nuanced to include backtracking when necessary. Rather than stubbornly pushing forward, it's often wise to reassess and adjust. Persist, but don’t overdo backtracking; never abandon your core mission. Distinguishing between good pain (indicative of effort) and bad pain (indicative of damage) is crucial in assessing progress. A quality audience is vital for morale, whether you’re a scholar or an artist. The size of the audience is less important than its quality; even a small, devoted audience can be highly sustaining. Direct engagement with your audience is invaluable, and where possible, circumventing intermediaries can enhance this connection, potentially warranting a shift to a field where direct engagement is feasible.

The individuals you surround yourself with can drastically affect your morale. Some people will uplift and energize you, while others may drain your spirit, often in surprising ways. Make a conscious effort to seek out those who enhance your energy and avoid those who deplete it. Yet, if you have a responsibility to care for someone, that duty should always come first.

Don't marry someone who views your work as a rival for your attention. Your ambition and work are vital, almost like a medical necessity. If your partner obstructs your work, they either don't understand or don't care. Morale is physical; you think with your body, so maintain a healthy lifestyle by exercising, eating, and sleeping well. Running and walking are excellent for thinking. Achievers might not be the happiest, but they're happier than if they were unproductive. Ambitious, intelligent people who don't achieve can become bitter. Wanting to impress others is fine, but focus on those you genuinely respect. Fame is just noise; the true value lies in how well you can do the work. Let curiosity guide you—it knows what's truly worth your focus. Curiosity isn't everything, but you can nurture it, and it's essential in all steps of doing great work. If you're still reading, you're interested in great work. The question is whether you find work where your ability and interest spark new ideas. Don't fear failure or appearing presumptuous; aim for greatness and let curiosity drive you. Yes, it'll be hard work, but if you're on the right path, it will feel less burdensome. The discoveries are out there, waiting to be made—why not by you?`,

### **Early years**

Hoffman joined [Apple Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Computer "Apple Computer") in 1994, where he worked on [eWorld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EWorld "EWorld"), an early attempt at building an online service.

### **LinkedIn**

Hoffman speaks at an event in 2008.

Hoffman co-founded [LinkedIn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn "LinkedIn") in December 2002 with two former colleagues from SocialNet (including Allen Blue) from his time at Fujitsu.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-Crown_Business-7)[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-20) LinkedIn launched on May 5, 2003 as one of the first business-oriented online social networks.[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-LinkedIn:_About-21) [Peter Thiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel "Peter Thiel"), a colleague of Hoffman's at PayPal, invested in LinkedIn. At the time of LinkedIn's [IPO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPO "IPO") on May 19, 2011, Hoffman owned a stake worth an estimated $2.34 billion, not including any potential benefits from [Greylock Partners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greylock_Partners "Greylock Partners"), where he was named a partner in 2009.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-22)

[Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft") proposed to acquire LinkedIn on June 13, 2016 for $26.2 billion in cash.[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-23) Hoffman became a Microsoft board member on March 14, 2017.[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-24)

### **Artificial Intelligence ventures\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reid_Hoffman&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Artificial Intelligence ventures")\]**

Hoffman was a founding investor in the [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence") research company [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI "OpenAI")[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-25) and joined its board in 2018.[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-26)

In March 2022, it was announced that Hoffman was co-founding a new startup, [Inflection AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection_AI "Inflection AI"), with his long-time friend and Greylock colleague [Mustafa Suleyman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Suleyman "Mustafa Suleyman"), the co-founder of [DeepMind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepMind "DeepMind"). [CNBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC "CNBC") reported that "Headquartered in Silicon Valley, Inflection will aim to develop AI software products that make it easier for humans to communicate with computers."[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-Shead-1)

In late 2022, Hoffman and others invested a total of $2.2 million in JusticeText. “\[G\]eared towards public defenders,” the platform “stores, catalogs, analyzes and then shares video evidence, hoping to increase transparency around criminal matters.”[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-27)

On March 3, 2023, Hoffman resigned from his board seat at OpenAI, citing a desire to avoid conflicts of interest between his board seat at OpenAI, investments in AI technology companies via Greylock Partners, and role as founder of Inflection AI.[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-28)

As of May 2023, Hoffman and Greylock Partners have invested in at least 37 AI companies.[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-29) For example, they were an early investor in Tome, makers of productivity software driven by AI. The company claims it is the fastest productivity software maker to reach 1 million users.[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-30)

Hoffman has dismissed calls to “pause” the development of advanced AI systems, calling such ideas “foolish” and “anti-humanist.” Instead, he has called for the pace of development to be accelerated to help humans solve societal problems.[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-31) For example, he’s pointed to “its potential to transform areas like health care — “giving everyone a medical assistant”; and education — “giving everyone a tutor….I’m a tech optimist, not a tech utopian.”[\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-32)

[Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inc._\(magazine\) "Inc. (magazine)") dubbed Hoffman the “evangelist in chief” for Inflection AI and AI in general, citing his meetings with the likes of President Biden and the Pope to discuss his vision and concerns around AI.[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-33)[\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-34)

In April of 2024, Hoffman “sat down” for an interview with an AI deepfake of himself. “In their conversation, the two Reids discussed AI regulation, its capabilities, and ways Hoffman can improve his LinkedIn profile.” According to Hoffman, the bot was “built on [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI "OpenAI")'s GPT-4 and trained on over 20 years' worth of material provided by Hoffman's public speaking engagements and the books he's published.”[\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-35)

Hoffman invested alongside Thiel in Facebook's first financing round.[\[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-38)[\[39\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-39)

Hoffman has made multiple investments in transportation technology companies, including Aurora, Convoy, Nauto, Nuro, and Joby Aviation, among others.[\[47\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-47)[\[48\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-48)

An early advocate for [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency "Cryptocurrency"),[\[49\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-49) Hoffman led Greylock's 2014 Series A financing round in Xapo, a company that developed a [bitcoin wallet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_wallet "Bitcoin wallet") product.[\[50\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman#cite_note-50)

# What Is Blitzscaling?

Blitzscaling is what we call both the general framework and the specific techniques that allow companies to achieve massive scale at incredible speed. If you’re growing at a rate that is so much faster than your competitors that it makes you feel uncomfortable, then hold on tight, you might be blitzscaling!

Amazon’s incredible growth in the late 1990s (and up through today) is a prime example of blitzscaling. In 1996, a pre-IPO Amazon Books had 151 employees and generated revenues of $5.1 million. By 1999, the now-public Amazon.com had grown to 7,600 employees and generated revenues of $1.64 billion. That’s a 50 times increase in staff and a 322 times increase in revenue in just three years. In 2017, Amazon had 541,900 employees and was forecast to generate revenues of $177 billion (up from $136 billion in 2016).

Dropbox founder Drew Houston described the feeling produced by this kind of growth when he told me, “It’s like harpooning a whale. The good news is, you’ve harpooned a whale. And the bad news is, you’ve harpooned a whale!”

While blitzscaling may seem desirable, it is also fraught with challenges. Blitzscaling is just about as counterintuitive as it comes. The classic approach to business strategy involves gathering information and making decisions when you can be reasonably confident of the results. Take risks, conventional wisdom says, but take calculated ones that you can both measure and afford. Implicitly, this technique prioritizes correctness and efficiency over speed.

Unfortunately, this cautious and measured approach falls apart when new technologies enable a new market or scramble an existing one.

Chris earned his MBA from Harvard Business School in the late 1990s, during the dawn of the Networked Age. Back then, his MBA training focused on traditional techniques, such as using discounted cash flow analysis to make financial decisions with greater certainty. Chris also learned about traditional manufacturing techniques, such as how to maximize the throughput of an assembly line. These methods focused on achieving efficiency and certainty, and the same emphasis was reflected in the broader business world. The world’s most valuable company during that time, General Electric, was beloved by Wall Street analysts for its ability to deliver consistent and predictable earnings growth. But efficiency and certainty, while innately appealing, and very important in the context of a stable, established market, offer little guidance to the disrupters, inventors, and innovators of the world.

When a market is up for grabs, the risk isn’t inefficiency—the risk is playing it too safe. If you win, efficiency isn’t that important; if you lose, efficiency is completely irrelevant. Over the years, many have criticized Amazon for its risky strategy of consuming capital without delivering consistent profits, but Amazon is probably glad that its “inefficiency” helped it win several key markets—online retail, ebooks, and cloud computing, to name just a few.

When you blitzscale, you deliberately make decisions and commit to them even though your confidence level is substantially lower than 100 percent. You accept the risk of making the wrong decision and willingly pay the cost of significant operating inefficiencies in exchange for the ability to move faster. These risks and costs are acceptable because the risk and cost of being too slow is even greater. But blitzscaling is more than just plunging ahead blindly in an effort to “get big fast” to win the market. To mitigate the downside of the risks you take, you should try to focus them—line them up with a small number of hypotheses about how your business will develop so that you can more easily understand and monitor what drives your success or failure. You also have to be prepared to execute with more than 100 percent effort to compensate for the bets that don’t go your way.

For example, anyone who knows Jeff Bezos knows that he didn’t simply mash his foot down on the gas pedal; Amazon has intentionally invested aggressively in the future, and, despite its accounting losses, generates a ton of cash. Amazon’s operating cash flow was over $16 billion in 2016, but it spent $10 billion in investments and $4 billion paying down debt. Its seemingly meager profits are a feature of its aggressive strategy, not a bug.

Blitzscaling requires more than just courage and skill on the part of the entrepreneur. It also requires an environment that is willing to finance intelligent risks with both financial capital and human capital, which are the essential ingredients for blitzscaling. Think of them as fuel and oxygen; you need both to propel the rocket skyward. Meanwhile, the infrastructure of your organization is the actual structure of your rocket, which you’re rebuilding on the fly as you rise. Your job as a leader and an entrepreneur is to make sure that you have sufficient fuel to propel your growth while making the necessary mechanical adjustments to the actual rocket ship to keep it from flying apart as it accelerates.

Fortunately, this is more possible today than it has ever been in the past.

# SOFTWARE IS EATING (AND SAVING) THE WORLD

Historically, stories of breakneck growth involved either computer software, which offers nearly unlimited scalability in terms of distribution, or software-enabled hardware, such as the Fitbit fitness tracker or Tesla electric car, whose software component allows the company to innovate on software timescales (days or weeks) rather than hardware timescales (years). Moreover, the speed and flexibility of software development allow companies to iterate and recover from the inevitable missteps of haste.

What’s especially exciting these days is that software and software-enabled companies are starting to dominate industries outside of traditional high tech. My friend Marc Andreessen has argued that “software is eating the world.” What he means is that even industries that focus on physical products (atoms) are integrating with software (bits). Tesla makes cars (atoms), but a software update (bits) can upgrade the acceleration of those cars and add an autopilot overnight.

The spread of software and computing into every industry, along with the dense networks that connect us all, means that the lessons of blitzscaling are becoming more relevant and easier to implement, even in mature or low-tech industries. To use a computing metaphor, technology is accelerating the world’s “clock speed” (the rate at which Central Processing Units \[CPUs\] operate), making change occur faster than previously thought possible. Not only is the world moving faster, but the speed at which major new technology platforms are being created is reducing the downtime between the arrivals of each wave of innovation. Before, individual waves would sweep through the economy one at a time—technologies like personal computers, disk drives, and CD-ROMs. Today, multiple major waves seem to be arriving simultaneously—technologies like the cloud, AI, AR/VR, not to mention more esoteric projects like supersonic planes and hyperloops. What’s more, rather than being concentrated narrowly in a personal computer industry that was essentially a niche market, today’s new technologies impact nearly every part of the economy, creating many new opportunities.

This trend holds tremendous promise. Precision medicine will use computing power to revolutionize health care. Smart grids use software to dramatically improve power efficiency and enable the spread of renewable energy sources like solar roofs. And computational biology might allow us to improve life itself. Blitzscaling can help these advances spread and magnify their sorely needed impact.

# THE TYPES OF SCALING

Blitzscaling isn’t simply a matter of rapid growth. *Every* company is obsessed with growth. In any industry, you live and die by the numbers—user acquisition, margins, growth rate, and so on. Yet growth alone is not blitzscaling. Rather, blitzscaling is *prioritizing speed over efficiency in the face of uncertainty*. We can better understand blitzscaling by comparing it to other forms of rapid growth.

*Efficiency*

*Speed*

*Uncertainty*

*Classic Start-up Growth*

*Blitzscaling*

*Certainty*

*Classic Scale-up Growth*

*Fastscaling*

**Classic start-up growth** prioritizes efficiency in the face of uncertainty. Starting a company is like jumping off a cliff and assembling an airplane on the way down; being resource-efficient lets you “glide” to minimize the rate of descent, giving you the time to learn things about your market, technology, and team before you hit the ground. This kind of controlled, efficient growth reduces uncertainty and is a good strategy to follow while you’re trying to establish certainty around what the authors Eric Ries and Steve Blank call product/market fit: your product satisfies a strong market demand for the solution to a specific problem or need.

**Classic scale-up growth** focuses on growing efficiently once the company has achieved certainty about the environment. This approach reflects classic corporate management techniques, such as applying “hurdle rates” so that the return on investment (ROI) of corporate projects consistently exceeds the cost of capital. This kind of optimization is a good strategy to follow when you’re trying to maximize returns in an established, stable market.

**Fastscaling** means that you’re willing to sacrifice efficiency for the sake of increasing your growth rate. However, because fastscaling takes place in an environment of certainty, the costs are well understood and predictable. Fastscaling is a good strategy for gaining market share or trying to achieve revenue milestones. Indeed, the financial services industry is often happy to finance fastscaling, whether by buying stocks and bonds or lending money. Analysts and bankers feel confident that they can create elaborate financial models that work out to the penny the likely ROI of a fastscaling investment.

**Blitzscaling** means that you’re willing to sacrifice efficiency for speed, but without waiting to achieve certainty on whether the sacrifice will pay off. If classic start-up growth is about slowing your rate of descent as you try to assemble your plane, blitzscaling is about assembling that plane faster, then strapping on and igniting a set of jet engines (and possibly their afterburners) while you’re still building the wings. It’s “do or die,” with either success or death occurring in a remarkably short time.

Given these definitions, you might wonder why anyone would ever pursue blitzscaling. After all, it combines the gut-wrenching uncertainty of start-up growth with the potential for a much bigger, more embarrassing, more consequential failure. Blitzscaling is also hard to implement. Unless you’re like Microsoft or Google and can finance your growth from an exponentially growing revenue stream, you’ll need to convince investors to give you money, and it’s much harder to raise money from investors for a calculated gamble (blitzscaling) than for a sure thing (fastscaling). To make matters worse, you usually need *more* money to blitzscale than to fastscale, because you have to keep enough capital in reserve to recover from the many mistakes you’re likely to make along the way.

Yet despite all of these potential pitfalls, blitzscaling remains a powerful tool for entrepreneurs and other business leaders. If you’re willing to accept the risks of blitzscaling when others aren’t, you’ll be able to move faster than they will. If the prize to be won is big enough, and the competition to win it is intense enough, blitzscaling becomes a rational, even optimal strategy.

Once you convince the market for capital and the market for talent—which include clients and partners, as well as employees—to invest in your scale-up, you have the fuel required to start blitzscaling. At that point, your objective switches from going from zero to one to going from one to one billion in an incredibly compressed time frame.

A company might employ different types of scaling at different points in its life cycle. The canonical sequence that companies like Google and Facebook have gone through begins with classic start-up growth while establishing product/market fit, then shifts into blitzscaling to achieve critical mass and/or market dominance ahead of the competition, then relaxes down to fastscaling as the business matures, and finally downshifts to classic scale-up growth when the company is an established industry leader. Together, this sequence of scaling generates a classic “S-curve” of growth, with slower initial growth followed by rapid acceleration, eventually easing its way into a gentle plateau.

![](blob:https://johnfactotum.github.io/7474a8cc-b212-41f6-a28b-76d44e60cfbe)

Of course, this canonical sequence is greatly simplified. The scaling cycle applies not just to whole companies but to individual products and business lines; the aggregate curves of these scaling cycles generate the overall scaling curve for the company.

For example, Facebook began as a classic blitzscaling story. The year-over-year revenue growth during its first few years of existence were 2,150 percent, 433 percent, and 219 percent, going from zero to $153 million in revenue in 2007. Then the company went through a key transition, and growth dropped into the double-digit range as Facebook struggled with both monetization and the shift from desktop to mobile. Fortunately, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg made two important moves: he personally led a shift from desktop-first to mobile-first, and he hired Sheryl Sandberg as the company’s COO, who in turn built Facebook into an advertising sales juggernaut. Growth rose back into the triple-digit range, and, by 2010, these moves had pushed Facebook’s revenues to over $2 billion. We’ll examine both of these key moves in greater detail later in the book, with Facebook’s shift to mobile featured in our analysis of Facebook’s business model, and Facebook’s hiring of Sheryl Sandberg in the section on the key transition from contributors to managers to executives.

Apple illustrates how this overlap looks over multiple decades. In its storied history, Apple went through complete scaling cycles for the Apple II, the Macintosh, the iMac, and the iPod (with the cycle for the iPhone still under way). It’s worth noting that Apple failed to launch any blitzscalable products after the Apple II and the Mac until Steve Jobs returned and launched the iMac, iPod, and iPhone. It was part of Steve’s rare genius that time and time again he was able to pick the right product for Apple to blitzscale, even without slowing down for a period of classic start-up growth to gather feedback from the market.

The scaling curve applies to every blitzscaler, regardless of industry or geography. The same multiple S-curve graph that describes Facebook or Apple also describes Tencent, which launched with QQ, then added a second curve for WeChat after QQ reached maturity in 2010. Just when you’ve finished blitzscaling one business line, you need to blitzscale the next to maintain your company’s upward trajectory. And as blitzscaling continues to spread, established companies with mature business lines should consider turning to intrapreneurs to blitzscale new business units.

# THE THREE BASICS OF BLITZSCALING

Blitzscaling requires you to move at a pace that is almost certainly uncomfortable for your team. You will definitely make many mistakes as you navigate an environment full of uncertainty; the art lies in developing the skill to learn quickly from those mistakes and return to a relentlessly rapid advance. But first, it’s critical to understand three basics.

## *1. BLITZSCALING IS BOTH AN OFFENSIVE STRATEGY* AND *A DEFENSIVE STRATEGY.*

On offense, blitzscaling allows you to do several things. First, you can take the market by surprise, bypassing heavily defended niches to exploit breakout opportunities. For example, Slack’s rapid growth after its launch blindsided a host of entrenched competitors like Microsoft and Salesforce.com. Second, you can leverage your lead to build long-term competitive advantages before other players are able to respond. We’ll explore this concept in greater detail later on. Third, blitzscaling opens up access to capital, because investors generally prefer to back market leaders. You can win this mantle if you blitzscale, and with it raise more money more easily and more quickly than your lagging competitors.

On defense, blitzscaling lets you set a pace that keeps your competitors gasping simply to keep up, affording them little time and space to counterattack. Because they’re focused on responding to your moves, which can often take them by surprise and force them to play catch-up, they don’t have as much time available to develop and execute differentiated strategies that might threaten your position. Blitzscaling helps you determine the playing field to your great advantage.

## *2. BLITZSCALING THRIVES ON POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOPS, IN THAT THE COMPANY THAT GROWS TO SCALE FIRST REAPS SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES.*

In April 2014, McKinsey & Company published a report entitled “Grow fast or die slow,” which analyzed the life cycles of three thousand software and Internet companies, and found that positive feedback loops made rapid growth the key factor in financial success:

> First, growth yields greater returns. High-growth companies offer a return to shareholders five times greater than medium-growth companies. Second, growth predicts long-term success. “Supergrowers”—companies whose growth was greater than 60 percent when they reached $100 million in revenues—were eight times more likely to reach $1 billion in revenues than those growing less than 20 percent.

We believe that the mechanism behind the power of blitzscaling is “first-scaler advantage.” Once a scale-up occupies the high ground in its ecosystem, the networks around it recognize its leadership, and both talent and capital flood in.

For one, top professionals understand that they can have a greater impact working for the market leader. Meanwhile, joining a scale-up that is clearly a “rocket ship” offers many of the financial rewards of working for an early-stage start-up, with far more certainty and far less risk. Scale-up employees are paid market salaries, receive equity upside, and have a very good chance of becoming rich, if not filthy rich. By attracting the best people, scale-ups increase their ability to build and bring to market great products, which in turn increases their ability to rapidly scale.

A parallel calculus applies to investors. Venture capitalists (VCs) make investment decisions based on the confidence interval they have in their investment thesis. Achieving scale shrinks those intervals and makes it easier to decide to invest. And because the network that connects investors—especially within a tight-knit ecosystem like Silicon Valley—can disseminate this information quickly and broadly, a blitzscaling company can raise capital on a massive scale. This capital infusion can fuel explosive growth, which shrinks the confidence intervals even further.

Paradoxically, globalization has both leveled the playing field for entrepreneurs around the world *and* increased the value of being in a premier scaling hub like Silicon Valley or China. Because the rest of the world believes that these ecosystems have an advantage in scaling up start-ups, those start-ups and their investors attract capital (human and financial) from all over the world, further bolstering their ability to keep growing. This is a key reason why scale-ups like Uber and Pinterest have achieved a scale and valuation that dwarf those of most publicly traded companies. Due to my role at Greylock Partners, I can’t comment on the valuations of Dropbox and Airbnb, but they occupy a similar place in the ecosystem.

Consider the case of two very similar companies, Twitter and Tumblr. Both had brilliant, product-oriented founders in Evan “Ev” Williams and David Karp. Both were hot social media start-ups. Both grew at a remarkable rate after establishing product/market fit. Both had a major impact on popular culture. Yet Twitter went public and achieved a market capitalization that peaked at nearly $37 billion, while Tumblr was acquired by Yahoo!—another start-up that used blitzscaling to become a scale-up, only to decline and fade away—for “only” $1 billion.

Was this dumb luck on Twitter’s side? Perhaps. Luck always plays a larger role than founders, investors, and the media would like to admit. But a major difference was that Twitter could draw on numerous networks for advice and help that Tumblr could not. For example, Twitter was able to bring in Dick Costolo, a savvy executive with prior scaling experience at Google. In contrast, even though Tumblr was arguably the most prominent start-up in its New York City ecosystem, it couldn’t easily draw upon a pool of local talent who had experience dealing with rapid growth. According to Greylock’s John Lilly, for every executive role that Tumblr needed to fill, there were less than a handful of candidates in all of New York City. This paucity of talent made hiring difficult; the company was reluctant to replace existing employees due to a lack of better alternatives. Without the ability to hire an executive team that could blitzscale, Tumblr decided to sell the company.

Of course, while geography can present challenges to blitzscaling, they become much more solvable if you’re aware of them. For example, over the past decade, Priceline—the world’s most successful online travel company—has been able to blitzscale from its headquarters in Connecticut. The CEO who led Priceline during its growth phase, Jeffery Boyd, saw advantages to this geographic isolation, noting that the company’s location meant that it faced fewer bidding wars for the key software engineers and designers needed to support the rapid growth of the business.

It’s extremely difficult for later entrants to compete directly with a blitzscaling company that has first-scaler advantage. Unless these players find a different game in which they can capture this advantage, they’ll simply become irrelevant.

## *3. DESPITE ITS INCREDIBLE ADVANTAGES AND POTENTIAL PAYOFFS, BLITZSCALING ALSO COMES WITH MASSIVE RISKS.*

Until recently, “Move fast and break things” was Facebook’s famous motto. Yet rapid growth can cause nearly as many problems as it solves. As Mark Zuckerberg told me in an interview for my *Masters of Scale* podcast, “We got to a point where it was taking us more time to go back and fix the bugs and issues that we’re creating than the speed that we were gaining by going faster.” In one famous incident, a summer intern introduced a bug that brought down the entire Facebook site for thirty minutes.

There is a scientific term for out-of-control growth in the human body: “cancer.” In this context, uncontrolled growth is clearly undesirable. The same is true for a business. Successful blitzscaling means that you’re maintaining at least some level of control by rapidly fixing the things that will inevitably get broken so that the company can maintain its furious pace without flaming out or collapsing in on itself. Like an American football player streaking down the field for a game-winning touchdown, even a company that has achieved first-scaler advantage can lose the ball prior to crossing the goal line if it takes on a bigger risk than it can handle.

Blitzscaling is risky from a management perspective as well. Reinventing your leadership style, your product, and your organization at every new phase of scale won’t be easy, but it is necessary. In the words of leadership guru Marshall Goldsmith, “What got you here won’t get you there.”

Market share and revenue growth earn headlines, but you can’t achieve customer and revenue scale without scaling up your organization, in terms of the size and scope of your staff, as well as your financial, product, and technology strategy. If the organization doesn’t grow in lockstep with its revenues and customer base, things can quickly spiral out of control.

For example, during a period of blitzscaling in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Oracle Corporation focused so single-mindedly on sales growth that its organization lagged badly on both technology (where it fell behind archrival Sybase’s) and finance and nearly went bankrupt as a result. It took the turnaround efforts of Ray Lane and Jeff Henley to stave off disaster and reposition Oracle for its later success.

Blitzscaling your organization will require hard choices and sacrifices; for example, the people who are adept at launching a company aren’t necessarily going to be the right people to scale it, as the Oracle example above demonstrates. Later in the book we’ll discuss how successful blitzscalers consciously manage growth rather than letting it manage them.

# THE FIVE STAGES OF BLITZSCALING

Blitzscaling a start-up isn’t a linear process; a global giant isn’t simply a start-up that’s been multiplied by one thousand, working out of a gleaming high-rise headquarters instead of a grimy garage. Each major increment of growth represents a qualitative as well as quantitative change. Drew Houston of Dropbox expressed this well when he told me, “The chessboard keeps adding new pieces and new dimensions over time.”

In the physical sciences, materials often undergo phase changes as their circumstances (e.g., temperature and pressure) change. Ice melts into water; water boils into steam. As a start-up scales up from one phase to the next, it undergoes fundamental changes as well.

And in the same way that ice skates are useless on water, and you can’t skip rocks on water vapor, the approaches and processes that worked for one phase break down once the scale-up reaches the next phase.

This book is designed to help you successfully navigate the phase changes you’ll face on the path to global dominance.

Throughout this book, we will refer to the five key stages of blitzscaling using the metaphor of a community. Since the most obvious, visible, and impactful change in a scale-up is the number of people it employs, we’ll define the stages based on the number of employees in the company, or its organizational scale.

# THE FIVE STAGES OF BLITZSCALING

*Stage 1 (Family)*

*1–9 employees*

*Stage 2 (Tribe)*

*10s of employees*

*Stage 3 (Village)*

*100s of employees*

*Stage 4 (City)*

*1000s of employees*

*Stage 5 (Nation)*

*10000s of employees*

Each stage has critical differences when it comes to management and leadership. When you’re head of a nuclear Family, you have close relationships with all of your Family members. When you’re the head of a whole Nation, you’re responsible for the lives of a multitude of people, most of whom you’ll never meet. (Later in the book we’ll talk about how to optimize your people management strategy as your company grows.)

It’s important to remember that while these powers of ten provide a clear and consistent set of categories, real life is often messier. For example, a start-up with a tight-knit team might feel and act like a Family even if it has nearly twenty employees. So these definitions are meant simply to offer a useful set of guidelines.

We also recognize that the number of employees is only one of several measures of an organization’s scale. Some of the other measures of scale include the number of users (user scale), the number of customers (customer scale), and total annual revenues (business scale). These measures usually, but don’t always, move in lockstep. While it’s nearly impossible to achieve customer scale or business scale without organizational scale—customers require customer service representatives, and revenues typically require salespeople—it is possible to achieve user scale without organizational scale. Consider the example of Instagram: when that company was acquired by Facebook for $1 billion, it had over one hundred million users but just thirteen employees and no significant revenues.

The fact that the phases don’t always move in lockstep is a *feature* of blitzscaling, not a bug. As we’ll discuss, operational scalability is one of the primary growth limiters that scale-ups need to address. When a business can grow users, customers, and revenues faster than the number of employees without collapsing under the weight of its own growth, the business can achieve greater profitability and keep growing without being as tightly constrained by the need for financial or human capital. In contrast, when the number of employees grows faster than users, customers, and revenues, it’s a major red flag that could indicate issues with the fundamental business model.

Nevertheless, for the sake of simplicity, this book will typically define the stage of a company by its organizational scale. A Family-stage company will have one to nine employees, a Tribe-stage company will have ten to ninety-nine employees, and so on. When exceptions arise, we’ll specifically call them out to avoid confusion.

# THE THREE KEY TECHNIQUES OF BLITZSCALING

Through much study of, direct access to, and conversation with the leadership at companies such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook—and through my own experiences as an entrepreneur and an investor—we’ve been able to identify the three key techniques applied by entrepreneurs and investors to build dominant companies. These basic principles do not depend on geography and can be adapted to build great companies in any ecosystem, albeit with varying degrees of difficulty.

## *TECHNIQUE #1: BUSINESS MODEL INNOVATION*

The first technique of blitzscaling is to design an innovative business model that can truly grow. This sounds like a Start-ups 101–level insight, but it’s astounding how many founders miss this key element. A major mistake made by many start-ups around the world is focusing on the technology, the software, the product, and the design, but neglecting to ever figure out the business. And by “business” we simply mean how the company makes money by acquiring and serving its customers. In contrast, despite the popular “engineers are gods” narrative prevalent in Silicon Valley, the companies and founders we universally hail as geniuses aren’t just technology nerds—they’re almost always business nerds too. At Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin built great search algorithms, but it was their innovations to the search engine *business model*—specifically, considering relevance and performance when displaying advertisements rather than simply renting space to the highest bidder—that drove their massive success.

As the world has gone digital, business model innovation has become even more important. So many technologies are available as services, which are on demand and built to be integrated, that technology is no longer as strong a differentiator, while figuring out the right combinations of services to bring together into a breakthrough product has become a major differentiator. Most of today’s successful companies are more like Tesla, which combines a set of technologies that already existed, rather than SpaceX, which had to pioneer new ones.

Business model innovation is how start-ups are able to outcompete established competitors who typically hold a host of advantages over any upstarts. As a start-up, Dropbox competes with giants like Microsoft and Google, who ought to have major advantages in technology, finance, and market power. Dropbox founder and CEO Drew Houston knows that his company can’t simply rely on better technology or outexecuting the competition: “If your playbook is the same as your competitor’s, you are in trouble, because chances are they are just going to run your playbook with a lot more resources!”

Drew had to design a better business model, in which the focus on sharing files means that the number of files Dropbox has to store (or in the past, pay Amazon to store) increases far more slowly than the value created for the customer and thus the revenues Dropbox can collect from those customers. Uber and Airbnb also built large businesses at incredible speed based on novel business models rather than unprecedented new technologies. If technological innovation alone were enough, federal research labs would produce $100 billion companies on a regular basis. Spoiler alert: they don’t.

This is not to say that technology innovation is unimportant. Technology innovation is the most common trigger for launching a new market or upending an existing one. Uber wasn’t the first company to try to improve the experience of hailing a taxi. But prior to the technological innovation of the smartphone, complete with wireless Internet connection and GPS-enabled location-based services, Uber’s business model simply wouldn’t have worked. These innovations reduced the friction for both driver and rider, making Uber’s core UberX ridesharing model a mass-market possibility for the first time.

Nor can companies afford to ignore technology innovation after they successfully blitzscale their way to City or Nation stage. Each and every one of the technology companies worth over $100 billion has used technology leadership to reinforce its competitive advantages. Amazon may have started as a simple online retailer with no unique technology, but today its technological prowess in cloud computing, automated logistics, and voice recognition help to maintain its dominance. In fact, the megacompanies built by blitzscaling are often the ones buying the technology innovators, much as Google bought DeepMind and Facebook bought Oculus.

Technology innovation is a key factor in retaining the gains produced by business model innovation. After all, if one technology innovation can create a new market, another technology innovation can render it obsolete, seemingly overnight. While Uber has achieved massive scale, the greatest threat to its future doesn’t come in the form of direct competitors like Didi Chuxing, though these are formidable threats. The greatest threat to Uber’s business is the technology innovation of autonomous vehicles, which could make obsolete one of Uber’s biggest competitive advantages—its carefully cultivated network of drivers—essentially overnight.

The key is to combine new technologies with effective distribution to potential customers, a scalable and high-margin revenue model, and an approach that allows you to serve those customers given your probable resource constraints.

Ideally, you design your business model innovation before you start your company. This is what happened when I cofounded LinkedIn. The key business model innovations for LinkedIn, including the two-way nature of the relationships and filling professionals’ need for a business-oriented online identity, didn’t just happen organically. They were the result of much thought and reflection, and I drew on the experiences I had when founding SocialNet, one of the first online social networks, nearly a decade before the creation of LinkedIn. But life isn’t always so neat. Many companies, even famous and successful ones, have to develop their business model innovation after they have already commenced operations.

PayPal didn’t have a business model when it began operations (I was a key member of the PayPal executive team). We were growing exponentially, at 5 percent per day, and we were losing money on every single transaction we processed. The funny thing is that some of our critics called us insane for paying customers bonuses to refer their friends. Those referral bonuses were actually brilliant, because their cost was so much lower than the standard cost of acquiring new financial services customers via advertising. (We’ll discuss the power and importance of this kind of viral marketing later on.)

The insanity, in fact, was that we were allowing our users to accept credit card payments, sticking PayPal with the cost of paying 3 percent of each transaction to the credit card processors, while charging our users nothing. I remember once telling my old college friend and PayPal cofounder/CEO Peter Thiel, “Peter, if you and I were standing on the roof of our office and throwing stacks of hundred-dollar bills off the edge as fast as our arms could go, we still wouldn’t be losing money as quickly as we are right now.” We ended up solving the problem by charging businesses to accept payments, much as the credit card processors did, but funding those payments using automated clearinghouse (ACH) bank transactions, which cost a fraction of the charges associated with the credit card networks. But if we had waited until we had solved this problem before blitzscaling, I suspect we wouldn’t have become the market leader.

## *TECHNIQUE #2: STRATEGY INNOVATION*

The most obvious element of blitzscaling is the pursuit of extreme growth, which, when combined with an innovative business model, can generate massive value and long-term competitive advantage. Many start-ups believe they are pursuing a strategy of extreme growth, when in fact they have the *goal* and the *wish* for extreme growth but no understanding of an actual strategy that will get them there. To achieve your goals, you have to know what you plan to do and, just as important, what you plan *not* to do. Also, growth doesn’t create value in and of itself; for that, it has to be paired with a working business model. It’s easy to achieve extreme customer and revenue growth if your company sells $20 bills for $1, but “we’ll make it up in volume” won’t allow you to build any sustainable value.

For successful blitzscaling, the competitive advantage comes from the growth factors built into the business model, such as network effects, whereby the first company to achieve critical scale triggers a feedback loop that allows it to dominate a winner-take-all or winner-take-most market and achieve a lasting first-scaler advantage. For example, Uber’s strategy of aggressive city-by-city expansion allows its customers to hail rides with fewer delays than its competitors. Uber wants you to be able to get a ride faster with Uber than with anyone else. This attracts more customers, which attracts more drivers, which increases the liquidity of the marketplace, which allows customers to hail rides even more quickly, which attracts more customers, and so on. Early Uber investor Bill Gurley laid out Uber’s strategy in his 2012 blog post “All Markets Are Not Created Equal.”

> As the company grows, they are able to facilitate more cars on the road, and along with their investment in route and load optimization, this allows for shorter and shorter pickup times. The experience gets better and better the longer they are in the market.

Blitzscaling goes beyond just a strategy of aggressive growth because it involves doing things that don’t make sense according to traditional business thinking, such as prioritizing speed over efficiency despite an uncertain environment. At the same time, blitzscaling also goes beyond just risk taking. It may be risky to bet the company, as Walt Disney did when he borrowed against his own life insurance to build Disneyland, but it’s not blitzscaling. Blitzscaling would have involved inefficiencies like paying construction crews to work twenty-four hours a day in order to get Disneyland open a few months earlier, or reducing ticket prices 90 percent to get to one million visitors faster—knowing that those one million visitors were networked to ten million more.

Here is one of the ruthless practices that has helped make Silicon Valley so successful: Investors will look at a company that is on an upward trajectory but doesn’t display the proverbial hockey stick of exponential growth and conclude that they need to either sell the business or take on additional risk that might increase the chances of achieving exponential growth. Achieving 20 percent annual growth, which would delight Wall Street analysts covering any other industry, simply isn’t enough to transform a start-up into a multibillion-dollar company fast enough. Silicon Valley venture capitalists want entrepreneurs to pursue exponential growth even if doing so costs more money and increases the chances that the business could fail, resulting in a bigger loss. Dropping below even 40 percent annual growth is a warning sign for investors.

This mindset can be difficult for people to understand. “Why should I risk it all and potentially blow up what is a successful, growing business?” they might rightfully ask. The answer is that blitzscaling businesses tend to play in winner-take-most or winner-take-all markets. The greater risk for a successful, growing business is to move too slowly and allow its competitors to win market leadership and first-scaler advantage.

Nokia is a great example of the cost of caution. In 2007, Nokia was the world’s largest and most successful maker of mobile phones, with a market capitalization of just under $99 billion. Then Apple and Samsung came blazing into the market. In 2013, Nokia sold its money-losing handset operations to Microsoft for $7 billion, and in 2016 Microsoft sold its feature phone assets and the Nokia handset brand to Foxconn and HMD for just $350 million. That’s a drop in value for Nokia’s mobile phone business from somewhere in the neighborhood of $99 billion to $350 million in less than a decade—a decline of over 99 percent.

At the time, Nokia’s decisions may have seemed to make sense. Nokia actually continued growing even after the launch of the iPhone and Google’s Android operating system. Nokia hit its peak in terms of unit volume when it shipped 104 million phones in 2010. But Nokia’s sales declined after that, and were surpassed by Android in 2011 and iPhone in 2012. By the time Nokia’s management realized the existential threat facing them, it was too late; even the desperation play of aligning themselves with Microsoft as its exclusive Windows Phone partner couldn’t reverse the decline.

Because blitzscaling often requires spending significant amounts of capital in ways that traditional business wisdom would consider “wasteful,” implementing a financial strategy that supports this aggressive spending is a critical part of blitzscaling. For example, Uber often uses heavy subsidies on both sides of the marketplace when it launches in a new city, lowering fares to attract riders and boosting payments to attract drivers. By paying out more than it takes in on those early trips, Uber is able to reach critical scale faster than a more conservative competitor. Given the winner-take-most nature of the ridesharing market, that “wasteful” spending has helped Uber achieve a dominant market position in the cities in which it operates. Of course, that strategy isn’t possible without the ability to raise massive amounts of capital on favorable terms. In Uber’s case, it has been able to raise nearly $9 billion between its founding and the writing of this book. At some point, Uber will have to demonstrate the ability to significantly improve its unit economics, or its investors will get very grumpy. This concern helps explain Uber’s significant investments in autonomous vehicle technology, which could eliminate its biggest expense—driver payments—in one fell swoop.

The willingness to take on the risks of blitzscaling is one of the major reasons why Silicon Valley has produced such a disproportionate share of blockbuster companies in comparison to other geographies. To be fair, it has also produced a disproportionate share of financial disasters—hence the word “risk” when talking about blitzscaling. But as the rise of juggernauts like Alibaba and Spotify illustrates, blitzscaling is also starting to take off around the world.

## *TECHNIQUE #3: MANAGEMENT INNOVATION*

The final technique required for blitzscaling is management innovation. This is necessary because of the extreme strains placed on the organization and its employees by hypergrowth.

I am fond of pointing out to entrepreneurs and executives that “in theory, you don’t need practice.”

What I mean is that no matter how brilliant your business model and growth strategy, you won’t be able to build a real-world (i.e., non-theoretical) blockbuster company without a lot of practice. But that problem is magnified when you’re trying to blitzscale.

The kind of growth involved in blitzscaling typically means major human resources challenges. Tripling the number of employees each year isn’t uncommon for a blitzscaling company. This requires a radically different approach to management than that of a typical growth company, which would be happy to grow 15 percent per year and can take time finding a few perfect hires and obsessing about corporate culture. As we will discuss in more detail later in the book, companies that blitzscale have to rapidly navigate a set of key transitions as their organizations grow, and have to embrace counterintuitive rules like hiring “good enough” people, launching flawed and imperfect products, letting fires burn, and ignoring angry customers.

Over the course of this book, we’ll see how business model, growth strategy, and management innovation work together to form the high-risk, high-reward process of blitzscaling.`,
		half: `Blitzscaling is a framework and set of tactics that allow companies to achieve massive scale quickly, often at an uncomfortable pace, as exemplified by Amazon's meteoric rise from 151 employees in 1996 to 541,900 in 2017. The dramatic increase in revenues, from $5.1 million to a forecasted $177 billion during the same period, reflects this rapid growth. Dropbox's Drew Houston likened it to the exhilarating yet daunting experience of "harpooning a whale." Unlike traditional strategies that emphasize calculated risks and efficiency, blitzscaling involves making rapid decisions with less confidence and accepting operational inefficiencies to gain speed. The goal is to capture new or disrupted markets, where the biggest risk is playing too cautiously. Critics have questioned Amazon's approach of consuming capital without consistent profits, but its strategy has proven successful in securing key markets like online retail and cloud computing. Blitzscaling requires substantial financial and human capital, as well as the ability to adapt the organizational structure dynamically, akin to adjusting a rocket mid-flight. This high-risk, high-reward strategy is increasingly feasible today, particularly with the advent of transformative technologies.

Historically, rapid growth often came from software and software-enabled hardware, like the Fitbit or Tesla, where software allows quick innovation and recovery from errors. Today, software is extending beyond traditional high-tech industries, as noted by Marc Andreessen's assertion that "software is eating the world." This fusion of software (bits) with physical products (atoms) enables continuous updates and improvements, such as Tesla's software upgrades for car performance. The integration of software into various industries accelerates change, akin to increasing the “clock speed” of the world’s CPUs, making innovations emerge faster and more simultaneously. Unlike the past, where technological waves like personal computers arrived sequentially, we now see concurrent innovations in cloud computing, AI, AR/VR, and more. This broad impact creates new opportunities across the economy, from precision medicine revolutionizing healthcare to smart grids enhancing power efficiency and computational biology improving life. Blitzscaling drives this transformative reach by prioritizing speed over efficiency amid uncertainty, distinct from mere rapid growth, as it focuses on swift scaling even at the cost of temporary inefficiencies.

Efficiency speed is all about integrating productivity with agility, ensuring that tasks are completed not only quickly but also with optimal performance. It’s the art of balancing speed without compromising on quality, making sure that every effort counts. This means utilizing tools and techniques that streamline processes, eliminate unnecessary steps, and drive results with precision. By focusing on efficiency speed, you’re not just getting things done faster, but smarter, ultimately leading to better outcomes and a more seamless workflow.

"Uncertainty" can feel like a heavy cloud lingering over our lives, twisting and turning our thoughts into knots of doubt and fear. It’s the unsettling feeling of not knowing what comes next and the paralyzing experience of grappling with the unknown. We often crave control and predictability, but life, with its inherent unpredictability, rarely grants us that comfort. Embracing uncertainty, though difficult, can open the door to growth, innovation, and resilience. It challenges us to let go of rigid expectations and adapt, fostering a deeper appreciation for the present and an openness to life's endless possibilities. It’s a complex, often unnerving journey, but it's within this journey that we find the strength to navigate the ever-changing landscape of our existence.

Blitzscaling is all about achieving rapid growth by prioritizing speed over efficiency during times of uncertainty, ideal for start-ups desperate to capture a market before competitors. In contrast, classic start-up growth involves steady, deliberate scaling, focusing on sustainability and minimizing risks. Certainty here allows for careful planning and resource management. Once a company matures into a classic scale-up, it can adopt ‘fastscaling’ techniques, which aim to maintain rapid expansion while introducing more operational efficiencies and reduced risks. This hybrid approach balances the aggressive blitzscaling tactics with the prudent strategies of classic start-up growth.

Starting a company feels like assembling an airplane while falling off a cliff, prioritizing efficiency to slow your descent, thus allowing time to learn about your market, technology, and team until achieving product/market fit as defined by Eric Ries and Steve Blank. Once certainty about the environment is attained, classic scale-up growth focuses on resource efficiency and maximizing ROI. Fastscaling trades some efficiency for higher growth rates in a predictable and understood environment, typically appealing to investors due to the clarity in ROI projections. Blitzscaling, on the other hand, sacrifices efficiency and operates without complete certainty, symbolizing a high-stakes, rapid growth strategy aimed at outpacing competition despite significant risks and potential needs for substantial investment. This approach, used by companies like Google and Facebook, can lead to rapid and exponential growth, followed by stabilization through fastscaling and classic scale-up growth once market dominance is achieved. This scaling pattern can be seen throughout the life cycles of successful firms like Facebook and Apple, which have gone through multiple scaling cycles for different products. The critical aspect of blitzscaling is the willingness to operate in discomfort, learning quickly from inevitable mistakes to maintain relentless progress.

Blitzscaling serves both as an offensive and defensive strategy, enabling companies to capture markets by surprise, build long-term competitive advantages, and access capital more easily, as illustrated by Slack's rapid growth outpacing established competitors. Defensively, it sets a relentless pace, forcing competitors to focus on catching up rather than developing differentiated strategies. This approach thrives on positive feedback loops, where companies that scale first gain significant advantages, attracting top talent and investment, as evidenced by high-growth companies achieving far greater returns and success. A "first-scaler advantage" helps companies like Uber and Pinterest reach valuations far surpassing most public companies. Geographic elements also play a role; for instance, Twitter capitalized on Silicon Valley's rich pool of experienced talent for scaling, unlike Tumblr, which struggled in New York City's talent-scarce environment and ended up selling to Yahoo! Successful examples like Priceline demonstrate that while geography can pose challenges, awareness and strategic isolation, as seen with its Connecticut headquarters, can mitigate these issues. Ultimately, blitzscaling creates a formidable barrier for late entrants unless they significantly differentiate their approach.

Blitzscaling, while offering incredible advantages and potential payoffs, inherently comes with massive risks.

Until recently, Facebook embraced the motto “Move fast and break things,” but rapid growth entailed its own challenges. As Mark Zuckerberg shared on my Masters of Scale podcast, the rapid pace often necessitated more time fixing issues than the gains achieved from moving quickly. One notable incident involved a summer intern introducing a bug that crashed the entire site for thirty minutes. Analogous to cancer in the human body, unchecked growth in business is equally detrimental. Successful blitzscaling involves efficiently addressing inevitable disruptions to maintain momentum without collapsing. As in American football, even a first-scaler advantage can be lost if risks aren't managed. Scaling requires constant reinvention of leadership, products, and organizational strategies at each new phase, aligning market share and revenue growth with organizational capacity. For instance, during its rapid expansion in the late '80s and early '90s, Oracle prioritized sales over technology and finance, nearly leading to bankruptcy until a turnaround. Scaling up involves difficult decisions, like replacing initial team members who may not suit the company's new phase. As Dropbox's Drew Houston noted, each growth phase necessitates different strategies, akin to how tools useful on ice are ineffective on water.

This book is designed to help you successfully navigate the phase changes you’ll face on the path to global dominance.

Throughout this book, we'll explore the five key stages of blitzscaling using the metaphor of a community. Since the most noticeable, visible, and impactful shift in a scale-up is the increase in the number of people it employs, we'll define these stages based on the number of employees in the company, also known as its organizational scale. Welcome to the journey of blitzscaling, starting with Stage 1: Family.

If your business has a small team of 1–9 employees, it's crucial to maximize agility and foster a collaborative environment. In such a close-knit setting, each team member plays a critical role in driving the company's success and has the opportunity to contribute meaningfully to various projects. Communication and adaptability are key, as the team dynamics can significantly influence business outcomes. Embrace the strengths and unique skills of each individual, and encourage an atmosphere of innovation and support. This approach not only enhances productivity but also cultivates a positive workplace culture that fuels growth and achievement.

- **Stage 2 (Tribe):** This stage involves tens of employees.
- **Stage 3 (Village):** At this stage, an organization grows into hundreds of employees.
- **Stage 4 (City):** Once the employee count reaches into the thousands, the organization can be considered at the city stage.
- **Stage 5 (Nation):** When the workforce expands into the tens of thousands, the organization has reached the nation stage.

Each stage of management and leadership, from a nuclear Family to a Nation, requires different approaches. While tight-knit start-ups might feel like a Family, even with nearly twenty employees, broader organization scales can involve millions of users or significant revenues with far fewer employees, like Instagram with its thirteen employees and over one hundred million users at the time of its acquisition by Facebook. This book classifies company stages primarily by employee count: Family-stage (1-9 employees), Tribe-stage (10-99 employees), and so on. However, organization scale is just one measure; user scale, customer scale, and business scale are other crucial metrics. These often, but not always, grow together, a feature not a bug in blitzscaling. The primary growth limiters include operational scalability, which, if managed well, enables business profitability and growth. Conversely, a disproportionate increase in employees versus users, customers, or revenues signals potential business model issues. Our discussion on optimizing people management and strategic exploitation of these scaling principles draws from extensive study and insights from industry leaders and personal entrepreneurial experiences.

# Technique #1: Business Model Innovation

The first technique of blitzscaling is designing an innovative business model that can grow efficiently, which is a surprisingly overlooked aspect by many start-ups who focus excessively on technology, software, and product design without a clear strategy for monetization. While Silicon Valley often celebrates "engineers as gods," successful companies often owe their triumphs to business acumen as much as technological prowess. Larry Page and Sergey Brin, for example, weren't only tech whizzes; their business model innovations at Google, particularly in ad relevance and performance, catapulted their success. As the digital landscape evolves, business model innovation outshines mere technological differentiation. Successful companies, like Tesla, often differentiate themselves by integrating existing technologies into groundbreaking products, unlike SpaceX, which pioneers entirely new technologies. Business model innovation is crucial for startups to compete with established giants, as seen in Dropbox's strategy to outmaneuver Microsoft and Google by optimizing file-sharing efficiencies. Companies like Uber and Airbnb scaled rapidly through innovative business models rather than groundbreaking tech. While technological innovation is vital for initiating and sustaining market leadership, as demonstrated by Amazon's evolution in cloud computing and logistics, the synergy of tech and business model innovation retains competitive advantages. For instance, Uber's rise would have faced dire challenges without smartphone-based technology but now must confront the looming threat of autonomous vehicles. Ultimately, blending new technologies with scalable revenue models, efficient distribution, and resource-conscious strategies is essential for success, ideally built into the business model from the start, though some companies refine it along the way, as LinkedIn did with insights from earlier ventures like SocialNet.

PayPal’s early days were marked by rapid growth and substantial losses, partly due to offering referral bonuses and absorbing credit card transaction fees. At one point, I joked with co-founder Peter Thiel about how we were losing money faster than if we were throwing it off the roof. We eventually addressed this issue by charging businesses and using lower-cost automated clearinghouse (ACH) transactions. This approach, a hallmark of "blitzscaling," involves pursuing extreme growth with innovative strategies, often incurring short-term inefficiencies for long-term market dominance. Blitzscaling emphasizes the importance of speed over efficiency in uncertain situations, leveraging network effects to build a competitive moat, as seen in companies like Uber and its focus on improving customer experience through rapid expansion. This method, characterized by heavy up-front spending and the ability to secure massive capital, is foundational to Silicon Valley's success but also carries significant risk, as evidenced by Nokia's fall from dominance due to slow adaptation. Blitzscaling’s acceptance is growing globally, showcased by companies like Alibaba and Spotify.

The final technique essential for blitzscaling is management innovation due to the immense pressures hypergrowth imposes on organizations and their employees. I often remind entrepreneurs and executives that “in theory, you don’t need practice,” highlighting that even the most brilliant business model and growth strategy require substantial real-world application to build a successful company. This challenge is intensified with blitzscaling, which typically involves significant human resources hurdles, such as tripling the employee count annually. This rapid growth necessitates a radically different management approach compared to a typical growth company, which might aim for 15 percent annual growth and can afford to meticulously select hires and focus on corporate culture. Blitzscaling companies, however, must rapidly navigate key organizational transitions and embrace counterintuitive practices like hiring “good enough” people, launching imperfect products, letting fires burn, and ignoring angry customers. Throughout this book, we’ll explore how business models, growth strategies, and management innovations converge to drive the high-risk, high-reward blitzscaling process.`,

Similarly, Dropbox's Drew Houston compared blitzscaling to "harpooning a whale," illustrating its thrilling yet risky nature. Unlike traditional approaches focused on calculated risks and operational efficiency, blitzscaling pushes for rapid decision-making with less certainty, embracing inefficiencies to speed up market capture, especially in disruptive environments. While Amazon's strategy of capital consumption without consistent profits has faced criticism, it has successfully secured essential markets like online retail and cloud computing. Blitzscaling demands significant financial and human resources, and the ability to dynamically adjust organizational structures, akin to fine-tuning a rocket mid-flight.

This strategy can cause significant disruptions but is crucial for rapid market dominance.

Successful blitzscaling combines tech innovation with business model innovation to scale efficiently, as demonstrated by companies like Uber, Airbnb, and Dropbox. The path includes adapting management practices to manage hypergrowth pressures. The book aims to guide through these phases, emphasizing the integration of new technologies, scalable revenue models, and strategic resource management for enduring success.`,

# Business Model Innovation

Of the three core techniques of blitzscaling, the first and most foundational is to design an innovative business model capable of exponential growth.

The story of entrepreneurship in the Internet era is a story of this kind of business model innovation.

Think back to the dot-com era, which stretched roughly from the IPO of Netscape in 1995 until the NASDAQ began to crash in 2000. During this period, enormous numbers of start-ups and pretty much every established company tried to build great Internet businesses, yet nearly all of them failed. The problem was, most of them simply tried to cut and paste existing business models onto the new online medium. You can’t transplant a heart from one species into another and expect it to thrive.

If you had asked stock market analysts in 1995 which companies were best positioned to dominate the Internet, most would have pointed to existing giants like Microsoft and Time Warner, which invested millions in Internet businesses like MSN and Pathfinder. Others would have mentioned “pure play” dot-com start-ups like eToys, which combined proven business models like the “category killer” store with the new online medium.

Yet when the wreckage of the dot-com crash cleared, the most successful companies still charging full steam ahead were the few start-ups that were designed around totally new business models, such as Amazon, eBay, and Google.

Walmart should have dominated online retail, yet Amazon emerged and practically wrote the bible for e-commerce, including consumer reviews, shopping carts, and free shipping. Newspapers and phone book companies should have been able to transfer their information businesses to the online world, but Yahoo! and then Google stepped up to the plate. They built the search engines that indexed the world’s information, and Google developed the business model that made it worth more than all traditional media companies combined.

In contrast, and much to their misfortune, start-ups that relied purely on technology innovation without any real business model innovation largely went bust. Companies like eToys that tried to “Amazon” various markets, but without Amazon’s front- and back-office innovations, crashed and burned once the financial markets began to demand profits rather than just expensive revenue growth. Even Netscape, whose Netscape Navigator mainstreamed Web browsing, and whose IPO kicked off the dot-com boom, was forced to sell itself off to AOL. Netscape engineers invented JavaScript, SSL, and all kinds of cool technology for the Internet that are still used today, but Netscape accepted the status quo when it came to using tried-and-true business models rather than developing new ones that were enabled by its own technology innovation. Unfortunately for Netscape, its competitor Microsoft already understood those business models all too well and knew exactly how to use its economic might and resources to pull their levers. In the first “browser war,” Microsoft preinstalled its Internet Explorer on all new Windows computers, then gave away its Web server software, Internet Information Server (IIS), which effectively destroyed Netscape’s business model.

Could Netscape have succeeded with a different strategy? We believe so. Consider that one of the ways that Netscape monetized its Navigator browser was to sell the sponsorship of its Net Search button to the Excite search engine for $5 million. Netscape believed that the browser itself was the key, while search was simply a sideline. It was left to two pairs of Stanford graduate students, Jerry Yang and David Filo (Yahoo!) and Larry Page and Sergey Brin (Google), to prove that search was a much bigger business. Google’s innovative model of selling text ads next to search results via an automated marketplace allowed it to build a franchise so dominant that it later withstood a series of frontal assaults by Microsoft, including a marketing program in which Microsoft essentially paid people to use its Bing search engine.

The same story has been repeated in multiple waves since. Facebook and LinkedIn dominate social networks even though AOL, Microsoft (Hotmail), and Yahoo! (Yahoo! Mail) controlled most consumer online identities when those social networks first emerged. Alibaba beat eBay in China. Uber outflanked the taxi companies. Airbnb has more room listings than any hotel company in the world.

These success stories are technology companies, sure. But as we’ve seen, technological innovation alone is insufficient—even when its impact on the future is huge. Services like Craigslist, Wikipedia, and IMDb (the Internet Movie Database) were early, influential Internet innovators, but they still never became massively (financially) valuable on their own.

The real value creation comes when innovative technology enables innovative products and services with innovative business models. Even though the business models of Google, Alibaba, and Facebook might seem obvious—even inevitable—after the fact, they weren’t widely appreciated at the time they launched. How many people in 1999 would have realized that running tiny text ads next to the equivalent of an electronic card catalog would lead to the world’s most valuable software company? Or that setting up an online shopping mall for China’s emerging middle class would lead to a $100 billion business? Which of you in 2004 would have predicted that letting people see what their friends are talking about by staring at a tiny screen on a handheld computer would become the dominant form of media? Great companies and great businesses often seem to be bad ideas when they first appear because business model innovations—by their very definition—can’t point to a proven business model to demonstrate why they’ll work.

To really understand why these business models succeed, we need to clearly define what we mean by “business model” in the first place. Part of the problem is that the term can be interpreted in so many different ways. The great management thinker Peter Drucker wrote that business models are essentially theories composed of assumptions about the business, which circumstances might require to change over time. Harvard Business School professor and author Clay Christensen believes that you need to focus on the concept of the “job-to-be-done”; that is, when a customer buys a product, she is “hiring” it to do a particular job. Then there’s Brian Chesky of Airbnb, who said simply, “Build a product people love. Hire amazing people. What else is there to do? Everything else is fake work.”

As Andrea Ovans aptly put it in her January 2015 *Harvard Business Review* article, “What Is a Business Model?”, it’s enough to make your head swim! For the purposes of this book, we’ll focus on the basic definition: a company’s business model describes how it generates financial returns by producing, selling, and supporting its products.

What sets companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook apart, even from other successful high-tech companies, is that they have consistently been able to design and execute business models with characteristics that allow them to quickly achieve massive scale and sustainable competitive advantage. Of course, there isn’t a single perfect business model that works for every company, and trying to find one is a waste of time. But most great business models have certain characteristics in common. If you want to find *your* best business model, you should try to design one that maximizes four key growth factors and minimizes two key growth limiters.

# DESIGNING TO MAXIMIZE GROWTH: THE FOUR GROWTH FACTORS

## *GROWTH FACTOR #1: MARKET SIZE*

The most basic growth factor to consider for your business model is market size. This focus on market size may sound obvious, and it’s right out of Pitch Deck 101 for start-ups, but if you want to build a massive company, you need to begin with the basics and eliminate ideas that serve too small of a market.

A big market has both a large number of potential customers and a variety of efficient channels for reaching those customers. That last point is important; a market consisting of “everyone in the world” might seem large, but it isn’t reachable in any efficient way. We’ll discuss this in greater depth when we look at distribution as a key growth factor.

It’s not easy to judge the size of a market, or what pitch decks and venture capitalists often refer to as TAM (total available market). Predicting TAM and how it will grow in the future is one of the main sources of uncertainty in blitzscaling. But predicting it correctly and investing accordingly when others are still paralyzed by fear is also one of the main opportunities for unexpectedly high returns, as we’ll see in the cases of Airbnb and Uber.

Ideally, the market itself is also growing quickly, which can make a smaller market attractive and a large market irresistible.

In Silicon Valley, the competition for venture capital exerts a strong pressure on entrepreneurs to focus on ideas that are going after big markets. Venture capital firms might raise hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars from their investors—limited partners like pension funds and university endowments—who are seeking above-market returns to compensate them for taking a chance on privately held companies rather than simply investing in the Coca-Colas of the world. To deliver these above-market returns, venture capital funds need to *at least* triple their investors’ money. A $100 million venture capital fund would need to return $300 million over the typical seven- to ten-year life of a fund to achieve an above-market internal rate of return of 15 to 22 percent. A $1 billion fund would need to return $3 billion. Since most venture capital investments either lose money or barely break even, the only realistic way that venture capitalists can achieve these aggressive goals is to rely on a small number of incredibly successful investments. For example, Benchmark Capital invested $6.7 million in eBay in 1997. Less than two years later, eBay went public, and Benchmark’s stake was worth $5 billion, which is a 745 times return. The specific fund that made that investment, Benchmark Capital Partners I, took $85 million from investors and returned $7.8 billion, for a 92 times return. (The initial investors in Facebook did even better, but were individuals rather than firms.)

Given the desire for home runs like eBay, most venture capitalists filter investment opportunities based on market size. If a company can’t achieve “venture scale” (generally, a market of at least $1 billion in annual sales), then most VCs won’t invest, even if it is a good business. It simply isn’t large enough to help them achieve their goal of returning more than three times their investors’ money.

When Brian Chesky was pitching venture capitalists to invest in Airbnb, one of the people he consulted was the entrepreneur and investor Sam Altman, who later became the president of the Y Combinator start-up accelerator. Altman saw Chesky’s pitch deck and told him it was perfect, except that he needed to change the market-size slide from a modest $30 million to $30 billion. “Investors want B’s, baby,” Altman told Chesky. Of course, Altman wasn’t telling Chesky to lie; rather, he argued that if the Airbnb team truly believed in their own assumptions, $30 million was a gross underestimate, and they should use a number that was true to their convictions. As it turns out, Airbnb’s market was indeed closer to $30 billion.

When evaluating market size, it’s also critical to try to account for how lower costs and product improvements can expand markets by appealing to new customers, in addition to seizing market share from existing players. In 2014, Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance at NYU’s Stern School of Business, estimated that Uber was probably worth roughly $6 billion, based on its ability to ultimately win 10 percent of the global taxi market of $100 billion, or $10 billion. According to Uber’s own projections, in 2016 the company processed over $26 billion in payments. It’s safe to say that the $10 billion market was a serious underestimate, as the ease of use and lower cost of Uber and its competitors expanded the market for transportation-as-a-service.

As Aaron Levie, the founder of the online file storage company Box noted in a tweet in 2014, “Sizing the market for a disruptor based on an incumbent’s market is like sizing a car industry off how many horses there were in 1910.”

The other factor that can lead to underestimating a market is neglecting to account for expanding into additional markets. Amazon began as Amazon Books, the “Earth’s Biggest Bookstore.” But Jeff Bezos always intended for bookselling to serve as a beachhead from which Amazon could expand outward to encompass his massive vision of “the everything store.” Today, Amazon dominates the bookselling industry, but thanks to relentless market expansion, book sales represent less than 7 percent of Amazon’s total sales.

The same effect can be seen in the financial results of Apple. In the first quarter of 2017, Apple generated $7.2 billion from the sale of personal computers, a category the company pioneered and once dominated. That’s a great number to be sure, but, over that same financial quarter, Apple’s total revenue was a whopping $78.4 billion, which meant that Apple’s original market accounted for less than 10 percent of its total sales.

My Greylock colleague Jerry Chen, who helped Diane Greene scale VMware’s virtualization software into a massive business, likes to point out, “Every billion-dollar business started as a ten-million-dollar business.”

But whether you are creating a new market, expanding an existing market, or relying on adjacent markets to get to those “B’s” that investors want (baby), you need to have a plausible path to get from here to there. This leads us to one of my favorite growth factors to discuss with entrepreneurs: distribution.

## *GROWTH FACTOR #2: DISTRIBUTION*

The second growth factor needed for a strong, scalable business is distribution. Many people in Silicon Valley like to focus on building products that are, in the famous words of the late Steve Jobs, “insanely great.” Great products are certainly a positive—we’ll discuss the lack of product quality as a growth *limiter* later on—but the cold and unromantic fact is that a good product with great distribution will almost always beat a great product with poor distribution.

Dropbox is a company with a great product, but it succeeded because of its great distribution. In an interview for Reid’s *Masters of Scale* podcast, founder and CEO Drew Houston said that he believes that too many start-ups overlook the importance of distribution:

> Most of the orthodoxy in Silicon Valley is about building a good product. I think that’s because most companies in the Valley don’t survive beyond the building-the-product phase. You have to be good at building a product, then you have to be just as good at getting users, then you have to be just as good at building a business model. If you’re missing any of the links in the chain, the whole chain is broken.

The challenge of distribution has become even greater in the “mobile first” era. Unlike the Web, where search engine optimization and e-mail links were broadly applicable and successful distribution channels, mobile app stores offer little opportunity for serendipitous product discovery. When you go to Apple’s or Google’s app store, you’re searching for a specific product. Few people install apps just for the hell of it. As a result, the business model innovators who have succeeded (e.g., Instagram, WhatsApp, Snap) have had to find creative ways to get broad distribution for their product—without spending a lot of money. These distribution techniques fall into two general categories: leveraging existing networks and virality.

### *A) Leveraging Existing Networks*

New companies rarely have the reach or resources to simply pour money into advertising campaigns. Instead, they have to find creative ways to tap into existing networks to distribute their products.

When I was at PayPal, one of the major vehicles for distribution of our payment service was settling purchases on eBay. At the time, eBay was already one of the largest players in e-commerce, and by the beginning of 2000 already had ten million registered users. We tapped into this user base by building software that made it extremely easy for eBay sellers to automatically add a “Pay with PayPal” button to all of their eBay listings. The amazing thing is that customers did so even though eBay had its own rival payments service, Billpoint! But sellers were required to add Billpoint manually to each of their listings; PayPal did it for them.

Many years later, Airbnb was able to perform a similar feat by leveraging the online classified service Craigslist. Based on a suggestion from Y Combinator’s Michael Seibel, Airbnb built a system that allowed and encouraged its hosts to cross-post their listings to the much-larger Craigslist. Hosts were told, “Reposting your listing from Airbnb to Craigslist increases your earnings by $500 a month on average,” and were allowed to do so by clicking a single button. This took serious technology skills—unlike many platforms, Craigslist doesn’t have an application programming interface (API) that allows other software to interact with it—but it was technology innovation for the purposes of distribution innovation, not product innovation. “It was a kind of a novel approach,” Airbnb founder Nathan Blecharczyk said of the integration. “No other site had that slick an integration. It was quite successful for us.”

Leveraging an existing network can have downsides, of course. What the existing network gives (or unknowingly allows to be taken), the existing network can also take away. Zynga, the leading social games company, achieved great success leveraging Facebook for distribution, but had to dramatically reengineer its distribution model after Facebook decided to stop allowing people playing Zynga games to post their progress to their Facebook friends. (Disclosure: I am a member of Zynga’s board of directors.) Zynga founder Mark Pincus was farsighted enough to build a strong enough franchise to survive the change.

In contrast, so-called content farms like Demand Media that leveraged Google’s search platform to generate website traffic and advertising revenues never recovered after Google tuned its algorithms to deprioritize content from what it called “junk” websites.

Despite these dangers, leveraging existing networks can be a critical part of a business model, especially if these networks can provide a “booster rocket” that is later supplemented with virality or network effects.

### *B) Virality*

“Viral” distribution occurs when the users of a product bring more users, and those users bring additional users, and so on, much like an infectious virus spreads from host to host. Virality can either be organic—occurring during the course of normal usage of the product—or incentivized by some kind of reward.

After launching LinkedIn, the team and I devoted significant time and energy to figuring out how to improve organic virality; that is, how to make it easier for existing users to invite friends to use the service. One way we did this was to refine what have become some of the standard tools of virality, such as address book importers. For example, we built software that allowed LinkedIn to connect to our users’ Outlook contacts, which made it very easy for them to invite their most important connections.

But equally important was an unanticipated source of virality. As it turned out, users wanted to use their LinkedIn pages as their primary professional identity on the Internet. Having a page like this to point others to—with all the details of their professional life together in one place—generated value not only for the user, but for the people viewing the page, and it made viewers realize that they should get their own LinkedIn profile. As a result, we added public profiles as a systematic tool to boost both the member value proposition and our viral growth rate.

At PayPal, we combined organic and incentivized virality. The payment product was inherently viral; if someone e-mailed you money using PayPal, you had to set up an account to get paid. But we enhanced this organic virality with monetary incentives. If you referred a friend to PayPal, you got $10, and your friend got $10. This combination of organic and incentivized virality allowed PayPal to grow 7 to 10 percent per day. As the PayPal network grew, we reduced the incentives to $5 and $5, then finally eliminated them altogether.

Incentives don’t have to be monetary; like PayPal, Dropbox used a similar combination of organic virality (as users share files with nonusers) and incentivized virality (Basic account holders get 500 MB of extra storage per user they refer; Pro account holders get 1 GB) to grow. Even though Dropbox invested in partnerships with leading PC makers like Dell, Drew Houston credits virality with driving the company’s rapid growth, helping it double its one hundred thousand users at launch to two hundred thousand users just ten days later, then skyrocket to one million users just seven months after that\*.\*

If your distribution strategy focuses on virality, you also have to focus on retention. Bringing new users in through the front door doesn’t help you grow if they immediately turn around and leave. According to Houston, Dropbox discovered this truth the hard way, when activation rates revealed that only 40 percent of the people signing up were actually putting files in their Dropbox and linking them to their computers. In an interview for my *Masters of Scale* podcast, Drew described a scene reminiscent of the television show *Silicon Valley* (but with a happier ending):

> What we did is we went on Craigslist and offered $40 to anyone who’d come in for half an hour—a poor man’s usability test. We’re like, “All right, sit down. This is an invitation to Dropbox in your e-mail. Go from here to sharing a file with this e-mail address.” Zero of the five people we tested succeeded. Zero of the five even came close. This was just stunning. We’re like, “Oh my God, this is the worst product ever created.” So we made a list of like eighty things in this Excel spreadsheet, then just sanded down all these rough edges in the experience, and watched our activation rate climb.

Virality almost always requires a product that is either free or freemium (i.e., free up to a certain point, after which the user has to pay to upgrade—Dropbox, for example, offers 2 GB of free storage). We can’t recall a single instance of a company that grew to a massive scale by leveraging the virality of a paid product.

One of the most powerful distribution innovations is to combine both strategies. Facebook was able to do this by harnessing the organic virality of a social network (where users invite other users to join them) and leveraging existing networks centered around campuses by rolling out the product on a college-by-college basis. We’ll discuss Facebook’s rollout strategy in greater depth when we consider network effects.

## *GROWTH FACTOR #3: HIGH GROSS MARGINS*

One of the key growth factors that entrepreneurs often overlook is the power of high gross margins. Gross margins, which represent sales minus the cost of goods sold, are probably the best measure of long-term unit economics. The higher the gross margin, the more valuable each dollar of sales is to the company because it means that for each dollar of sales, the company has more cash available to fund growth and expansion. Many high-tech businesses have high gross margins by default, which is why this factor is often overlooked. Software businesses have high gross margins because the cost of duplicating software is essentially zero. Software-as-a-service (SaaS) businesses have a slightly higher cost of goods sold because they need to operate a service, but thanks to cloud providers like Amazon, this cost is becoming smaller all the time.

In contrast, “old economy” businesses often have low gross margins. Growing wheat is a low-margin business, as is selling goods in a store or serving food in a restaurant. One of the most amazing things about Amazon’s success is that it has been able to build a massive business based on retailing, which is generally a low-margin industry. And even Amazon now relies heavily on its high-margin SaaS business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). In 2016, AWS accounted for 150 percent of Amazon’s operating income, which means that the retail business actually lost money.

Most of the valuable companies we’re focusing on in this book have gross margins of over 60, 70, or even 80 percent. In 2016, Google had a gross income of $54.6 billion on sales of $89.7 billion, for a gross margin of 61 percent. Facebook’s gross income was $23.9 billion on sales of $27.6 billion, for a gross margin of 87 percent. In 2015, LinkedIn’s gross margin was 86 percent. As we’ve already discussed, Amazon is the outlier, with a 2016 gross income of $47.7 billion on $136 billion in sales, for a gross margin of 35 percent. Yet even Amazon’s gross margins are greater than those of a “high margin” traditional company like General Electric, which in 2016 had a gross income of $32.2 billion on sales of $119.7 billion, for a gross margin of 27 percent.

High gross margins are a powerful growth factor because, as noted below, not all revenue is created equal. The key insight here is that even though gross margins matter a great deal to the seller, they are irrelevant to the buyer. How often do you consider the gross margin involved when you make a purchase? Would you ever choose Burger King over McDonald’s because Whoppers are lower margin than Big Macs? Typically, you focus solely on the cost to you, and the perceived benefits of the purchase. This means that it’s not necessarily any easier to sell a low-margin product than a high-margin product. If possible then, a company should design a high-gross-margin business model.

Second, high-gross-margin businesses are attractive to investors, who will often pay a premium for the cash-generating power of such a business. As the prominent investor Bill Gurley wrote in his 2011 blog post, “All Revenue Is Not Created Equal,” “Investors love companies where, all things being equal, higher revenues create higher profit margins. Selling more copies of the same piece of software (with zero incremental costs) is a business that scales nicely.” Appealing to investors makes it easier to raise larger amounts of money at higher valuations when the company is privately held (we’ll delve into the details of why this is so important later on), and lowers the cost of capital when the company is publicly traded. This access to capital is a key factor in being able to finance lightning-fast growth.

It’s important to note the difference between potential gross margin and realized gross margin. Many blitzscalers, such as Amazon or the Chinese hardware makers Huawei and Xiaomi, deliberately price their products to maximize market share rather than gross margins. As Jeff Bezos is fond of saying, “Your margin is my opportunity.” Xiaomi explicitly targets a net margin of 1 to 3 percent, a practice it credits Costco for inspiring. All other factors being equal, investors almost always place a much higher value on companies with higher potential gross margins than companies that have already maximized their realized gross margins.

Finally, most of a company’s operational challenges scale based on revenues or unit sales volume, not gross margin. If you have a million customers who generate $100 million per year in sales, the cost to serve those customers doesn’t change whether your gross margin is 10 percent or 80 percent; you still need to hire enough people to respond to their support requests. But it’s a lot easier to afford good customer support when you have $80 million in gross margin to spend rather than $10 million.

Conversely, it’s a lot easier to sell and service 125,000 customers who generate $12.5 million per year in sales and $10 million in gross margin than it is to have to sell and service a million customers who generate $100 million in sales to achieve that same $10 million in gross margin. That’s eight times as many customers and eight times the revenues, which means eight times as many salespeople, customer service representatives, accountants, and so on.

Designing a high-gross-margin business model makes your chances of success greater *and* the rewards of success even greater. As we’ll see in a later section, high gross margins have helped even nontech businesses, such as the Spanish clothing retailer Zara, grow into global giants.

## *GROWTH FACTOR #4: NETWORK EFFECTS*

Market size, distribution, and gross margins are important factors in growing a company, but the final growth factor plays the key role in *sustaining* that growth long enough to build a massively valuable and lasting franchise. While the past twenty years have driven improvements in the first three growth factors, the rise in Internet usage around the world has pushed network effects to levels never before seen in our economy.

The increasing importance of network effects is one of the main reasons that technology has become a more dominant part of the economy.

At the end of 1996, the five most valuable companies in the world were General Electric, Royal Dutch Shell, the Coca-Cola Company, NTT (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone), and ExxonMobil—traditional industrial and consumer companies that relied on massive economies of scale and decades of branding to drive their value. Just twenty-one years later, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the list looked very different: Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook. That’s a remarkable shift. Indeed, while Apple and Microsoft were already prominent companies at the end of 1996, Amazon was still a privately held start-up, Larry Page and Sergey Brin were still a pair of graduate students at Stanford who were two years away from founding Google, and Mark Zuckerberg was still looking forward to his bar mitzvah.

So what happened? The Networked Age happened, that’s what.

Technology now connects all of us in ways that were unthinkable to our ancestors. Over two billion people now carry smartphones (many of them made by Apple, or using Google’s Android operating system) that keep them constantly connected to the global network of everything. At any time, those people can find almost any information in the world (Google), buy almost any product in the world (Amazon/Alibaba), or communicate with almost any other human in the world (Facebook/WhatsApp/Instagram/WeChat).

In this highly connected world, more companies than ever are able to tap into network effects to generate outsize growth and profits.

We’ll use the simple layman’s definition of network effects in this book:

> A product or service is subject to positive network effects when increased usage by any user increases the value of the product or service for other users.

Economists refer to these effects as “demand-side economies of scale” or, more generally, “positive externalities.”

The magic of network effects is that they generate a positive feedback loop that results in superlinear growth and value creation. This superlinear effect makes it very difficult for any node in the network to switch from an incumbent to an alternative (“customer lock-in”), since it is almost impossible for any new entrant to match the value of plugging into the existing network. (Nodes in these networks are typically customers or users, as in the canonical example of the fax machine, or the more recent example of Facebook, but can also be data elements or other fundamental assets valuable in a business.)

The resulting phenomenon of “increasing returns to scale” often results in an ultimate equilibrium in which a single product or company dominates the market and collects the majority of its industry’s profits. So it’s no surprise that smart entrepreneurs strive to create (and smart investors want to invest in) these network effects start-ups.

Several generations of start-ups have tapped these dynamics to build dominant positions, from eBay to Facebook to Airbnb. To accomplish these goals, it’s critical to develop a rigorous understanding of how network effects work. My Greylock colleague Simon Rothman is one of the world’s premier experts on network effects from building eBay’s $14 billion automotive marketplace. Simon warns, “A lot of people try to bolt on network effects by doing things like adding a profile. ‘Marketplaces have profiles,’ they reason, ‘so if I add profiles, I’ll be adding network effects.’ ” Yet the reality of building network effects is a bit more complicated. Rather than simply imitate specific features, the best blitzscalers study the different types of network effects and design them into their business models.

### *Five Categories of Network Effects*

On his industrial organization of information technology website, the NYU professor Arun Sundararajan classifies network effects into five broad categories:

1. **Direct Network Effects:** Increases in usage lead to direct increases in value. (Examples: Facebook, messaging apps like WeChat and WhatsApp)

2. **Indirect Network Effects:** Increases in usage encourage consumption of complementary goods, which increases the value of the original product. (Example: Adoption of an operating system such as Microsoft Windows, iOS, or Android encourages third-party software developers to build applications, increasing the value of the platform.)

3. **Two-Sided Network Effects:** Increases in usage by one set of users increases the value to a different set of complementary users, and vice versa. (Example: Marketplaces such as eBay, Uber, and Airbnb)

4. **Local Network Effects:** Increases in usage by a small subset of users increases the value for a connected user. (Example: Back in the days of metered calls, certain wireless carriers allowed subscribers to specify a limited number of “favorites” whose calls didn’t count against the monthly allotment of call minutes.)

5. **Compatibility and Standards:** The use of one technology product encourages the use of compatible products. (Example: within the Microsoft Office suite, Word’s dominance meant that its document file format became the standard; this has allowed it to destroy competitors like WordPerfect and fend off open-source solutions like OpenDocument.)

Any of these different network effects can have a major impact; Microsoft’s ability to tap into multiple network effects with Windows and Office contributed greatly to its unprecedentedly durable franchise. Even today, Windows and Office remain dominant in the PC market; it’s simply that other platforms like mobile have achieved similar or greater importance.

### *Network Effects Both Produce* and *Require Aggressive Growth*

A key element of leveraging network effects is the aggressive pursuit of network growth and adoption. Because the impact of network effects increases in a superlinear fashion, at lower levels of scale, network effects actually exert downward pressure on user adoption. Once all your friends are on Facebook, you have to be on Facebook too. But conversely, why would you join Facebook if none of your friends had joined yet? The same is true for the first user of marketplaces like eBay and Airbnb.

With network effects businesses, you can’t start small and hope to grow slowly; until your product is widely adopted in a particular market, it offers little value to potential users. Economists would say that the business has to get past the “tipping point” where the demand curve intersects with the supply curve. Companies like Uber subsidize their customers in an attempt to manipulate the demand curve to reach that tipping point faster; the bet is that losing money in the short term may allow you to make money in the long term, once you’re past the tipping point.

One challenge that this approach produces is the (eventual) need to eliminate the subsidies in order to make the unit economics work. When I was at PayPal, one of the things we did to encourage adoption was to proclaim that the service would always be free. This meant eating the transaction costs of accepting credit card payments. I wish I could say we had a grand plan. We had hoped that we could make up for the credit card transaction fee subsidy by making money off the float—the funds being kept in PayPal. Unfortunately, this came nowhere close to offsetting the fee subsidies, and the company was hemorrhaging money. So we switched PayPal from “always free” to “ACH always free” and started charging fees to accept credit card payments. Fortunately, we already had a loyal following, and our customers accepted the change.

When the business can’t change the economics of the product (free services like Facebook can’t lower their prices), it can instead sway the expectations of potential users. The value users place on the service when deciding whether or not to adopt it depends on both the current level of adoption *and* their expectations for future adoption. If they think others are going to jump on board, the perceived value of the service increases, and they become more likely to adopt it.

This technique is reflected in one of the most influential business books of all time, Geoffrey Moore’s *Crossing the Chasm*. Moore argues that technology companies often run into problems when they try to transition from a market of early adopters to the mainstream—the proverbial “chasm.” He recommends that companies focus on niche beachhead markets, from which the company can expand outward using a “bowling pin” strategy in which these markets help to open up adjacent markets. This strategy is even more important for network effects businesses.

A company can also reshape the demand curve by designing the product to be valuable to the individual user regardless of network adoption. At LinkedIn, for example, we discovered that public LinkedIn profiles had some value independent of the user’s network, since they served as an online professional identity. This gave people a reason to join LinkedIn even if their friends and colleagues hadn’t done so yet.

### *Connectivity Enables Network Effects Businesses*

In addition to supporting network effects, the high connectivity of the world we live in today also makes it easier to reach the tipping point where network effects kick in, and to sustain those network effects and the market dominance they produce.

First, the Internet has driven the cost of discovery for products and services lower than ever. Unlike in the past, when companies needed to offer goods in retail stores or broadcast advertising in order to be visible to customers, today buyers can find whatever they’re looking for on Amazon or other online marketplaces like Alibaba, in app stores, or, when all else fails, by Googling. Because products and services that are already popular will almost always come up first in search results, companies with a competitive advantage can quickly grow to the point where the increasing returns of network effects produce a winner-take-most or winner-take-all market. This also explains why the growth factor of distribution is as or more important to company success as the product itself—without distribution, it is difficult to reach the tipping point.

After network effects take hold, the efficiencies enabled by the Networked Age make it easier to sustain the pace of rapid growth. In the past, rapid customer growth inevitably led to rapid organizational growth and to dramatic increases in the overhead required to coordinate a large number of employees and teams. Today’s networks allow companies to sidestep these traditional growth limiters, such as when Apple used Foxconn to get around the potential limitation of its manufacturing infrastructure (more on this in the next section). The more you can remove those limiters, the more dominant a network effects–driven business can grow. This is why companies like Google that have surpassed the $100 billion mark in annual revenues are still growing at over 20 percent per year.

Finally, the remarkable profitability of these companies gives them the financial resources to expand into new fields and invest in the future. The S-curve of innovation argues that the rate of adoption of every innovation eventually slows as the market saturates. However, companies like Apple have mastered the strategy of investing in new products that let them hop onto additional S-curves. Apple hopped from music players to smartphones to tablets, and it is no doubt spending some of its vast profits chasing the next S-curve. The premium that the public markets grant these companies also helps them use mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to jump these curves, much as Facebook did with Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus, and Google did with DeepMind.

Of course, network effects don’t apply to every company or market, even if they are superficially similar—as many companies and their investors discovered to their chagrin during the dot-com bust, the Great Recession, and the funding slowdown of 2016. This is why the best entrepreneurs try to design innovative business models that leverage network effects. One of the reasons that Google is Google and Yahoo! is now part of AOL (which in turn is owned by Verizon) is that Google focused on AdWords (a marketplace with strong network effects) while Yahoo! tried to become a media company (a traditional model based on economies of scale).

Much of Silicon Valley’s historical success in building giant companies can be traced to its cultural emphasis on business model innovation, which results in the creation of network effects–driven businesses. The irony is that many people in Silicon Valley couldn’t define a network effect or what caused it if asked. Yet simply because so many entrepreneurs are trying so many different business models, they can end up stumbling into powerful network effects. Craig Newmark simply started e-mailing his friends about local events in 1995; almost twenty-two years later, network effects have kept Craigslist a dominant player in online classifieds despite operating with a skeleton crew and making seemingly no changes to the website design during that entire period!

This is where an emphasis on speed also plays an important role. Because Silicon Valley’s entrepreneurs focus on designing business models that can get big fast, they are more likely to incorporate network effects. And because the fierce local competition forces start-ups to grow so aggressively (i.e., blitzscale), Silicon Valley start-ups are more likely to reach the tipping point of network effects before start-ups from less aggressive geographies.

One of the motivations for this book is to help entrepreneurs from around the world emulate these successes by teaching them how to systematically design their businesses for blitzscaling. When you design your business model to leverage network effects, you can succeed anywhere.

# DESIGNING TO MAXIMIZE GROWTH: THE TWO GROWTH LIMITERS

Building key growth factors into your innovative business model is only half the battle. It is fiendishly difficult to grow an amazing business, in part because it is fiendishly easy to run smack into obstacles that *limit* your growth. A key component of business model innovation is designing around these growth limiters.

## *GROWTH LIMITER #1: LACK OF PRODUCT/MARKET FIT*

Product/market fit enables rapid growth, while the lack of it makes growth expensive and difficult. The concept of product/market fit originates in Marc Andreessen’s seminal blog post “The Only Thing That Matters.” In his essay, Andreessen argues that the most important factor in successful start-ups is the combination of market and product.

His definition couldn’t be simpler: “Product/market fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market.”

Without product/market fit, it’s impossible to grow a start-up into a successful business. As Andreessen notes,

> You see a surprising number of really well-run start-ups that have all aspects of operations completely buttoned down, HR policies in place, great sales model, thoroughly thought-through marketing plan, great interview processes, outstanding catered food, 30" monitors for all the programmers, top tier VCs on the board—heading straight off a cliff due to not ever finding product/market fit.

Unfortunately, it’s far easier to define product/market fit than it is to establish it!

When you start a new company, the key product/market fit question you need to answer is whether you have discovered a nonobvious market opportunity where you have a unique advantage or approach, and one that competing players won’t see until you’ve had a chance to build a healthy lead. It’s usually difficult to find such an opportunity in a “hot” space; if an opportunity is obvious to everyone, the chance that you’ll be the one who succeeds is exceedingly low.

Most nonobvious opportunities arise from a change in the market that the incumbents aren’t willing or able to adapt to. In many cases, this can be a disruptive technological innovation, but it can also be a change in the law or financial regulations, the rise of a new group of customers, or any other major shift. For example, Charles Schwab was able to build his eponymous financial empire by leveraging the deregulation of brokerage commissions to launch a discount brokerage.

Frequently, you won’t be able to fully validate product/market fit before you commit to building a company. But you should try. As authors and entrepreneurs, we’re huge fans of Eric Ries and his lean start-up methodology. It is an excellent process for systematically tackling risk. But the fact is that most start-ups don’t follow that process; instead, their chosen experiment is “Do we succeed or run out of money?”

The best way for a small, resource-strapped team to assess potential strategies is to leverage what we dubbed “network intelligence” in our previous book, *The Alliance*. Even a small group of founders is likely to have a huge collective personal network of smart people with relevant knowledge or experience. Initiate a conversation, inviting them to challenge your idea and tell you what else you should consider.

Of course, even the best network intelligence won’t guarantee that you’ve actually found product/market fit during this design phase. The only way to truly prove product/market fit is to get the product into the hands of real users. But entrepreneurs can and should do their research, and try to design their business model to maximize their chances of achieving product/market fit as quickly as possible.

## *GROWTH LIMITER #2: OPERATIONAL SCALABILITY*

Designing a scalable economic model isn’t enough if you can’t scale up your operations to meet demand. Too often, entrepreneurs dismiss the challenges of operational scalability by saying, “Managing explosive growth is a high-class problem.” High-class problems are still problems; it may feel better for your ego to be wrestling with the issues of growth rather than simply trying to avoid missing payroll, but both can still kill your company. Rather than dismiss these challenges, the wisest innovators design operational scalability into their models.

### *A) Human Limitations on Operational Scalability*

A significant number of operational issues arise simply because of human limitations. As much as we might wish that we and our colleagues could work tirelessly and seamlessly, regardless of the scale of the organization, the fact is that growth causes us to trip over a wide array of issues.

If you are leading a small founding team with four members, you have to worry about your direct relationship with the three other cofounders, plus their direct relationships with one another. Combinatorial mathematics tells us that this means you need to manage the relationships between six pairs of individuals (\[4\*3\] / 2). Now imagine that you hire two employees, for a total team size of six. Now you need to manage the relationships between fifteen pairs (\[6\*5\] / 2). You increased the team size by 50 percent, but the number of relationships you need to manage went up by 150 percent. The math just gets more daunting from there. And that only considers the relationships of individual pairs of team members, not the relationships between any three members, any four members, and so on.

One approach is to design a business model that requires as few human beings as possible. Some software companies employ business models that allow them to achieve massive success with minimal numbers of employees. The founders of WhatsApp, Jan Koum and Brian Acton, designed a clever business model that addressed some of the key growth factors (their messaging service leveraged both classic network effects and the existing distribution network of telephone address books to grow faster) but also managed to skirt around issues of operational scalability. WhatsApp had a freemium business model; the service was free for a year, after which it cost $1 per year. This low-friction model essentially eliminated the need for people working in functions like sales, marketing, and customer service, allowing WhatsApp to grow to five hundred million monthly active users by the time of its acquisition by Facebook, with a staff of just forty-three employees, a ratio of over ten million active users per employee!

Another approach is to find ways to outsource work to contractors or suppliers. Airbnb’s strategy for photographing its hosts’ rooms offers an instructive example. Early on, Airbnb’s founders discovered that one of the key factors that increased the chances of renting a room on Airbnb was the quality of the photographs of that room. It turns out that most of us aren’t professional photographers, and our poorly composed, poorly shot cell phone pictures don’t do a good job of conveying the awesomeness of our living spaces. So the founders took to the road, visiting hosts and taking photographs for them. Obviously, personally visiting every host was hardly a scalable solution, so the the task was soon outsourced to freelance photographers. As Airbnb grew, the strategy shifted from the founders managing a short list of photographers, to an employee managing a large group of photographers, to an automated system managing a global network of photographers. Founder Brian Chesky describes this strategy succinctly: “Do everything by hand until it’s too painful, then automate it.”

Ultimately, even with clever business models and automation, nearly every massively successful company requires thousands or even tens of thousands of employees. Smart techniques can delay the reckoning, but not forever. Later on, we’ll discuss some of the management innovations that allow companies to handle this kind of organizational growth and scale.

### *B) Infrastructure Limitations on Operational Scalability*

The other main challenge of operational scalability comes from the strain of scaling up the nonhuman infrastructure of the business. It doesn’t matter how much demand you generate if your infrastructure can’t handle it. Infrastructure limitations can even be fatal to a company’s ambitions. Consider the examples of the social networks Friendster and Twitter.

While many have forgotten it now, Friendster was the first (pre-Facebook) online social network to break through into the mainstream (disclosure: I was an early investor in Friendster). Launched in March 2003, Friendster rode viral growth to millions of users within months. Before the year was out, Friendster-mania was such a cultural phenomenon that founder Jonathan Abrams appeared on the late-night television program *Jimmy Kimmel Live!* But Friendster’s massive growth brought massive headaches, especially on the infrastructure side. Despite a talented technology team, Friendster’s servers couldn’t handle the growth, and it became common for Friendster profiles to take up to forty seconds to load. By the beginning of 2005, a faster new entrant, MySpace, was generating more than ten times the number of pageviews as Friendster, which never recovered. MySpace, of course, ultimately lost the consumer social networking war to Facebook, which is a story we’ll discuss in detail later in this book.

Twitter came close to melting down in the same way, but managed to recover in time to build a massive business. When Twitter began its rise in the late 2000s, it became infamous for its “Fail Whale,” a whimsical error message that appeared whenever its servers couldn’t handle the load. Unfortunately for Twitter, the Fail Whale made fairly regular appearances, especially when big news hit, such as the death of the recording artist Michael Jackson in 2009 (to be fair, Twitter was hardly the only website that had these issues when the King of Pop passed away) or the 2010 World Cup. Twitter invested serious resources into rearchitecting both its systems and its engineering processes to be more efficient. Even with this strenuous effort, it took several years to “tame” the Fail Whale; it wasn’t until after Twitter made it through the 2012 US presidential election night without melting down that the company’s then–creative director Doug Bowman announced that the Great Blue Whale had been put to death.

One of the main reasons for the very large increase in the growth of valuable Web companies that we’ve seen in recent years is Amazon’s cloud offering, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which has helped many such businesses navigate around infrastructure limitations. Dropbox, for example, was able to scale up its storage infrastructure much more quickly and easily because it used AWS storage, eliminating the need to build and maintain its own arrays of hard disks.

AWS reflects one of the ways that Amazon has made operational scalability a competitive advantage. Web services like AWS tap into what Harvard Business School professor Carliss Baldwin and former Harvard Business School professor Kim Clark refer to as “the power of modularity.” As Baldwin and Clark describe in their book, *Design Rules, Vol 1: The Power of Modularity,* this principle makes it possible for a company like Amazon and its customers to build complex products out of smaller, standardized subsystems. But the power of modularity goes beyond just software development and engineering. By building easy-to-integrate subsystems like payments and logistics, Amazon makes its entire business more flexible and rapidly adaptable.

The equivalent to AWS on the hardware side is China. Hardware start-ups are able to manage infrastructure limitations and scale much more quickly by tapping into Chinese manufacturing capabilities, either directly or by working with companies like the custom manufacturing design firm PCH. The smart thermostat maker Nest, for example, had only 130 employees when it was acquired by Google for $3 billion, largely because it had outsourced all of its manufacturing to China.

In contrast, Tesla Motors has seen its growth held back by infrastructure limitations. Due to the complexities of its manufacturing process, Tesla’s production rates have lagged behind those of other automakers, the result being that its award-winning vehicles are almost always sold out, with back orders measured in months and even years. Demand generation is not a problem for Tesla; meeting that demand is.

# PROVEN BUSINESS MODEL PATTERNS

Whether by design or not, the business models of rapidly growing companies often follow proven patterns that tap into growth factors and bypass growth limiters. These patterns will be described in more detail below, but here it bears noting that these high-level patterns are principles rather than exact recipes. Simply adopting any of these particular patterns isn’t enough to ensure an innovative business model, but understanding them does provide an entrepreneur with a set of good role models.

It is also worth mentioning that not all patterns are created equal. Some common business models follow proven patterns, but nonetheless don’t seem to produce $100 billion businesses or even $10 billion businesses. Take open-source software, which has been wildly successful as a pattern for spreading software products like Linux. Open source, which means offering free, community-created software that users can modify, arose to prominence during the dot-com era and has been an integral part of the world’s technology stack ever since.

The story of open-source software fits the pattern of business model innovation. Open-source software serves a large market, has powerful distribution via open-source software code repositories, benefits from the network effects of standards and compatibility, and neatly avoids many of the human limitations on operational scalability by tapping into a distributed community of volunteer contributors rather than building a large organization of employees.

Yet even the most successful open-source business, Red Hat, has a market capitalization of “only” about $15 billion, and that’s after being in business for two decades. The empirical evidence suggests that open source is a pattern that is valuable for engagement but not for building a massively profitable business.

In order for a pattern to be proven, it must be able to demonstrate that multiple massively valuable businesses follow it. Based on that criterion, we’ve assembled the following list of proven patterns to help inspire your own business model innovation.

## *PROVEN PATTERN #1: BITS RATHER THAN ATOMS*

Google and Facebook are largely software businesses that focus on electronic bits rather than material atoms. Bits-based businesses have a much easier time serving a global market, which in turn makes it easier to achieve a large market size. Bits are also far easier to move around than atoms, so bits-based businesses can more easily tap into distribution techniques like virality, and their ability to be highly networked provides more opportunities to leverage network effects. Bits-based businesses tend to be high-gross-margin businesses because they have fewer variable costs.

Bits also make it easier to design around growth limiters. You can iterate more quickly on software products (many Internet companies release new software daily) than on physical products, making it faster and cheaper to achieve product/market fit. And bits-based businesses, as we saw with WhatsApp, can get away with far fewer employees than most of their atom-based counterparts.

Back in 1990, the futurist George Gilder demonstrated his prescience when he wrote in his book *Microcosm,* “The central event of the twentieth century is the overthrow of matter. In technology, economics, and the politics of nations, wealth in the form of physical resources is steadily declining in value and significance. The powers of mind are everywhere ascendant over the brute force of things.”

Just over twenty years later, in 2011, the venture capitalist (and Netscape cofounder) Marc Andreessen validated Gilder’s thesis in his *Wall Street Journal* op-ed “Why Software Is Eating the World.” Andreessen pointed out that the world’s largest bookstore (Amazon), video provider (Netflix), recruiter (LinkedIn), and music companies (Apple/Spotify/Pandora) were software companies, and that even “old economy” stalwarts like Walmart and FedEx used software (rather than “things”) to drive their businesses.

Despite—or perhaps because of—the growing dominance of bits, the power of software has also made it easier to scale up atom-based businesses as well. Amazon’s retail business is heavily based in atoms—just think of all those Amazon shipping boxes piled up in your recycling bin! Amazon originally outsourced its logistics to Ingram Book Company, but its heavy investment in inventory management systems and warehouses as it grew turned infrastructure limitations from a growth limiter to a growth factor. On the retail side, merchants pay Amazon to manage their inventories and logistics for them, while the massive computer systems that Amazon built to operate its retail business gave it the capabilities to launch its AWS business (which is a high-margin, bits-based business!).

## *PROVEN PATTERN #2: PLATFORMS*

Platform economics predates the Networked Age, and even the Industrial Age. Trade-oriented principalities like the Republic of Venice provided a welcoming ecosystem for merchants, complete with currency and the rule of law, as well as taxes to harvest the value of the platform. Technology platforms like Microsoft Windows demonstrated the power of being the chosen platform on which businesses were built back when the World Wide Web was still a glimmer in Tim Berners-Lee’s eye (Sir Berners-Lee wrote his proposal for a global hypertext system in 1989). Yet despite the proven value of platforms in the pre-Internet era, the Networked Age has made them vastly more powerful and valuable.

Rather than being limited like the Republic of Venice to a specific geography, today’s software-based platforms can achieve global distribution almost immediately. And since transactions on today’s platforms are conducted through application programming interfaces (APIs) rather than person-to-person negotiations, they proceed swiftly, seamlessly, and in incredible volumes, all with barely any human intervention.

If a platform achieves scale and becomes the de facto standard for its industry, the network effects of compatibility and standards (combined with the ability to rapidly iterate and optimize the platform) create a significant and lasting competitive advantage that can be nearly unassailable. This dominance lets the market leader “tax” all the participants who want to use the platform, much as levies were imposed in the bygone Republic of Venice. For example, the iTunes store takes a 30 percent share of the proceeds whenever a song, a movie, a book, or an app is sold on that platform. These platform revenues tend to have very high gross margins, which generate cash that can be plowed back into making the platform even better. Amazon’s merchant platform, Facebook’s social graph, and, of course, Apple’s iOS ecosystem are great examples of the power of platforms.

## *PROVEN PATTERN #3: FREE OR FREEMIUM*

“Free” has an incredible power that no other pricing does. The Duke behavioral economist Dan Ariely wrote about the power of free in his excellent book *Predictably Irrational,* describing an experiment in which he offered research subjects the choice of a Lindt chocolate truffle for 15 cents or a Hershey’s Kiss for a mere penny. Nearly three-fourths of the subjects chose the premium truffle rather than the humble Kiss. But when Ariely changed the pricing so that the truffle cost 14 cents and the Kiss was free—the same price differential—more than two-thirds of the subjects chose the inferior (but free) Kisses.

The incredible power of free makes it a valuable tool for distribution and virality. It also plays an important role in jump-starting network effects by helping a product achieve the critical mass of users that is required for those effects to kick in. At LinkedIn, we knew that our basic accounts had to be free if we wanted to get to the million users we theorized represented critical mass.

Sometimes you can offer a product for free and still be profitable; in the advertising-driven business model, a large enough mass of free users can be valuable even if they never pay for your service. Facebook, for example, doesn’t charge its users a dime, but it is able to generate large amounts of high-gross-margin revenue by selling targeted advertising. But sometimes a product doesn’t lend itself to the advertising model, as is the case with many services used by students and educators. Without third-party revenue, the problem with offering your product to users for free is that you can’t offset your lack of sales by “making it up in volume.”

Here is where the innovation of freemium comes in. The venture capitalist Fred Wilson coined the term in a 2006 blog post (based on a suggestion from Jarid Lukin), but the business model itself predates the term, having its origin in the “shareware” model for selling software in the 1980s. The free product was a tool for discovery and gaining a critical mass of users, while the paid version of the software allows the business to extract value from those users once its value is clear. Dropbox is one of the premier examples of a successful freemium business—by giving away 2 GB of storage, Dropbox attracted a massive user base, a reasonable percentage of which decides to pay for the value and convenience of additional storage.

## *PROVEN PATTERN #4: MARKETPLACES*

Marketplaces represent one of the most successful business model patterns, with the dot-com era’s Google and eBay and today’s Alibaba and Airbnb standing out as examples of important, valuable companies that follow this pattern. One reason marketplaces are powerful is because they often tap into two-sided network effects. While it is difficult to create a successful marketplace from a cold start, the first marketplace that does manage to achieve liquidity—the ability for buyers and sellers to quickly and efficiently find a counterparty to conduct a transaction—becomes very attractive to both sides of the market. As buyers and sellers pour in, the marketplace becomes even more attractive to both parties, triggering a positive feedback loop that makes it very hard for new entrants to win any market share.

Marketplaces also offer key advantages beyond the obvious network effects. By creating a liquid market where buyers and sellers both participate, the dynamic forces of supply and demand price their transactions better than any human judgment could. The more efficient the prices in a marketplace, the more value it creates, because that means more transactions that *might* create value actually occur. In contrast, in illiquid markets, sellers often misprice their products, resulting in fewer sales and less value creation than optimal.

The best example of the benefits of efficient market pricing is probably Google’s AdWords advertising marketplace. AdWords allows anyone to bid on targeted keywords, in any quantity, so even the smallest businesses can tap into global distribution. Contrast this to the traditional advertising market, in which large clients spend millions of dollars paying advertising agencies to run expensive thirty-second television ads during coveted programming like the Super Bowl broadcast. Google’s system also measures advertising quality; ads targeted at its audience to generate the most paid click-throughs are favored. The net effect is that consumers are shown the most effectively targeted ads, without the overhead of a middleman like Don Draper and his three-martini lunch. Google also increases its own gross margin, because, unlike commercials during a television broadcast, search-based ad space is virtually unlimited and costs Google next to nothing.

Although marketplaces, even local ones, have always been a powerful business model, the changes ushered in by the Networked Age have made them potentially more valuable than ever. But unlike a local market with its size constraints—think of an old-fashioned bazaar in the center of a populous city—online marketplaces tap a global market. And by connecting buyers and sellers instead of holding inventory or managing logistics (and thus dealing in bits rather than atoms), online marketplaces avoid many of the growth limits of human or infrastructure scalability.

## *PROVEN PATTERN #5: SUBSCRIPTIONS*

When Salesforce.com first launched its on-demand customer relationship management product, there were many legitimate questions about this new software-as-a-service (SaaS) model. Selling software as a subscription, delivered via the Internet, represented a major departure for enterprise software vendors. The previous model of selling permanent licenses for on-premise software and charging for maintenance provided more cash up front than monthly or annual subscriptions. The personnel required to support the model were also different; selling and supporting on-premise software required field salespeople and sales engineers to install pilot deployments, while the new SaaS model required additional staff to provide 24/7 data center coverage and support.

As it turns out, of course, SaaS eventually became the dominant business model for enterprise software. The cash flow disadvantages and required personnel shifts were real concerns, but mainly for existing players in the market. New SaaS businesses like Salesforce.com and Workday were designed and built around the new model, giving them a major advantage over existing players who tried to convert their on-premise software businesses to subscription ones.

Subscription Internet services have been successful because the sales and delivery model provides a larger market size and better distribution than traditional packaged software. Due to the cost and overhead of the extensive field operations required to support on-premise software, traditional enterprise software licenses had to be in the six- or seven-figure range simply to make the model work. This meant that software vendors focused on the needs of only the largest customers.

In contrast, Salesforce.com and other SaaS vendors can sell software licenses in any quantity, not only to Fortune 500 companies, but also to midmarket and small to medium-sized businesses, significantly enlarging their potential market. Internet delivery and self-service allow new forms of distribution that weren’t possible in the packaged software world, such as Dropbox’s viral incentive of additional free storage for referring new customers.

Nor is the pattern of Internet subscriptions limited to enterprise software. The dominant players in both music (Spotify, Pandora) and video (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon) also enjoy lower overhead and greater distribution by using the subscription business model.

Another, less obvious benefit to this model is that once a subscription business achieves scale, the predictability of its revenue streams allows it to be more aggressive with long-term investments, since it isn’t obliged to maintain large cash balances to weather short-term variations in the business. This financial firepower can represent a major competitive advantage. For example, Netflix, which announced plans to invest $6 billion in original content for its streaming service in 2017, has exploited its direct subscription model to outspend classic television networks, which have to rely on less robust revenue streams like payments from cable providers and advertising sales.

## *PROVEN PATTERN #6: DIGITAL GOODS*

One of the emerging patterns that build on new platforms and services is the business of selling digital goods. Sitting at the intersection of “bits rather than atoms” and platforms, digital goods are intangible products that, arguably, have no intrinsic value—but they can still make for a profitable and scalable business. For example, the messaging service LINE derives significant revenues by selling “stickers”: images that are incorporated into the text of smartphone messages. In 2014, its first year of operation, LINE’s sticker business generated $75 million in revenue. That figure grew to $270 million in 2015, which represented over a quarter of LINE’s total revenues. Not bad for an intangible product with no intrinsic value!

Digital goods have also become a key business model in the video game industry, with in-game purchases of digital items that can help players advance in the game or advertise their status. Market-wide revenue from in-app purchases are projected to outstrip paid-app downloads in 2017, $37 billion to $29 billion.

In addition to enjoying the advantages of any bits-based business, digital goods tend to have nearly 100 percent gross margins, since they are purely digital and usually do not add significantly to infrastructure or overhead costs.

## *PROVEN PATTERN #7: FEEDS*

One of the most underrated and underappreciated proven patterns is the news feed. Facebook’s powerful network effects allow the site to attract its users, but its innovation of the news feed has made it a world-class business. Yet Facebook is hardly the only feed-centric success story. Companies like Twitter, Instagram, and Slack have all built multibillion-dollar market values around the news feed pattern.

The power of the news feed comes from its ability to drive user engagement, which in turn drives both advertising revenue and long-term retention. As Facebook has demonstrated, a news feed with sponsored updates is the most effective way to monetize proverbial Internet “eyeballs.” Facebook’s News Feed’s dominance of the online advertising market is only exceeded by Google’s AdWords, and AdWords starts with the significant built-in advantage of capturing active consumer intent rather than simply the desire to be amused. For example, how many people visit Facebook with the intention of going shopping? The magic of the news feed model has been its ability to monetize bored people catching up on what their friends are doing.

Of course, effective use of the news feed model requires a lot of sophisticated technology. Facebook doesn’t just insert sponsored updates at random. The company knows your interests better than you do, based on all the items you’ve ever clicked on, liked, or otherwise engaged with. It can carefully target the advertisements it shows you based on your individual habits and the context of what surrounds them in your feed. This targeting ability explains why Facebook succeeded in monetizing this model when other feed-based products like RSS readers failed.

This pattern is so powerful that Twitter, whose product is essentially one long news feed, is still an important Internet company despite barely changing its product in nearly a decade (going from 140 characters to 280 characters doesn’t count). Twitter is a business that scaled massively because of the power of business model innovation, not product or technology innovation.

# THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES OF BUSINESS MODEL INNOVATION

Underlying the proven patterns of business model innovation are larger principles that can help refine those patterns or even create new ones. These principles aren’t themselves business models, but they often power the technological innovation that enables business model innovation.

## *UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE #1: MOORE’S LAW*

Moore’s Law is the fundamental principle that puts the “Silicon” in Silicon Valley, and has powered the worldwide ascent of the technology industry. Moore’s Law is named after its codifier, Intel cofounder Gordon Moore, who coined the term in a paper he wrote in 1965, observing that the number of transistors that could be crammed onto the surface of a silicon chip appeared to double each year. While Moore revised his eponymous law in 1975 to a doubling of transistors every twenty-four months, the industry has since settled on a broad consensus of eighteen months. Today, Moore’s Law no longer refers specifically to transistor density; rather, it predicts that computing power tends to double every eighteen months. In recent years, this growth in computing power has been driven by the transition to multicore, multithreaded computing. Perhaps in the future, Moore’s Law will be met by quantum computing, optical chips, the use of DNA, or something even more impossible to foresee. The point is, it appears that the true limit to Moore’s Law is human engineering ingenuity, not solid-state physics.

Moore’s Law matters because the relentless increase in computing power that it predicts acts as a constant source of technological innovation, which, as we have seen, can help enable business model innovation. For many years, the power of Intel’s central processing units (CPUs) was measured by their “clock rate”—the number of times per second that the CPU could perform an operation. While clock rate is no longer a good measure of computing power, it is still a good metaphor for how Moore’s Law drives the world of computer technology: each tick of the clock enables new technologies, driving faster and faster innovations.

Increasing computing power allowed the shift from gigantic mainframes to smaller minicomputers to personal computers, all the way to today’s smartphones and wearables. We’ve seen similar increases in things like network bandwidth, allowing the Web to shift from text to images to audio to video, and in the future, 3-D and virtual reality (VR). Yet today’s smartphones aren’t simply smaller versions of IBM mainframes—remember, technology innovation enables business model innovation.

The best entrepreneurs don’t just follow Moore’s Law; they anticipate it. Consider Reed Hastings, the cofounder and CEO of Netflix. When he started Netflix, his long-term vision was to provide television on demand, delivered via the Internet. But back in 1997, the technology simply wasn’t ready for his vision—remember, this was during the era of dial-up Internet access. One hour of high-definition video requires transmitting 40 GB of compressed data (over 400 GB without compression). A standard 28.8K modem from that era would have taken over four months to transmit a single episode of *Stranger Things*. However, there was a technological innovation that would allow Netflix to get partway to Hastings’s ultimate vision—the DVD.

Hastings realized that movie DVDs, then selling for around $20, were both compact and durable. This made them perfect for running a movie-rental-by-mail business. Hastings has said that he got the idea from a computer science class in which one of the assignments was to calculate the bandwidth of a station wagon full of backup tapes driving across the country! This was truly a case of technological innovation enabling business model innovation. Blockbuster Video had built a successful business around buying VHS tapes for around $100 and renting them out from physical stores, but the bulky, expensive, fragile tapes would never have supported a rental-by-mail business.

(As hard as it may be for some readers to comprehend, when we were in college, we would often drive to a Blockbuster Video store on a Friday or Saturday night, pay a couple of bucks to rent a VHS tape of a movie, and use a landline telephone to call Domino’s to order a pizza before popping the videotape into a VCR that was connected to a twenty-five-inch standard-definition cathode-ray tube.)

DVD technology allowed Netflix to create a completely new business model. Rather than renting out individual movies and being charged exorbitant late fees if they failed to return the VHS tape in time, Netflix customers paid $20 per month for a subscription to “unlimited” movies—provided they checked out just one movie at a time. This allowed Netflix to eliminate Blockbuster’s widely loathed late fees and capture the powerful and certain revenue stream from the proven model of a subscription service. Netflix took off, and even went public as a DVD-by-mail service.

But Hastings never lost sight of his ultimate vision for Netflix—on-demand television delivered via the Internet. And as Moore’s Law continued to work its magic, making computers ever more powerful and Internet bandwidth ever greater and cheaper, Netflix bided its time, waiting for streaming video to become viable.

“When we first started raising money in 1997, we thought we’d be mostly streaming in 5 years,” Hastings told us when he visited our Blitzscaling class at Stanford. “In 2002, we had no streaming. So we thought that by 2007, it would be half our business. In 2007, we were still nowhere. So we made the same prediction. And this time we were wrong the other way—by 2012, streaming was 60% of our business.” It may have taken longer than Hastings expected, but Moore’s Law eventually came through for him.

Today, Netflix is synonymous with television on demand delivered via the Internet, and it has created an entirely new category of “binge watching.” As of 2017, 53 percent of American adults say that their household has access to Netflix, and the service is growing rapidly across the rest of the world. Netflix has used the financial power of its subscription model to become one of the premier sources of original video content, from television shows like *Stranger Things,* to movies like *Beasts of No Nation,* to events like comedian Dave Chappelle’s comeback stand-up comedy specials.

Traditional television commissions large numbers of pilot episodes, the majority of which never make it to series, trying to produce optimistically named “Must See TV” to appeal to a broad audience, which has to be convinced to tune in every single week. In contrast, the on-demand model allows Netflix to cater to many different audiences rather than program a small number of thematic channels, as cable television does. Broadcast television succeeded by providing the same thing to all its viewers—a model driven by the technological innovation of broadcasting content via wireless signals and later coaxial cable. Netflix succeeds by providing a carefully personalized experience to each of its many viewers, giving it a huge advantage over its traditional television competitors. Moreover, Netflix produces exactly what it knows its customers want based on their past viewing habits, eliminating the waste of all those pilots, and only loses customers when they make a proactive decision to cancel their subscription. The more a person uses Netflix, the better Netflix gets at providing exactly what that person wants. And increasingly, what people want is the original content that is exclusive to Netflix. The legendary screenwriter William Goldman famously wrote of Hollywood, “Nobody knows anything.” To which Reed Hastings replies, “Netflix does.” And all this came about because Hastings had the insight and persistence to wait nearly a decade for Moore’s Law to turn his long-term vision from an impossible pipe dream into one of the most successful media companies in history.

Moore’s Law has worked its magic many other times, enabling new technologies ranging from computer animation (Pixar) to online file storage (Dropbox) to smartphones (Apple). Each of those technologies followed the same path from pipe dream to world-conquering reality, all driven by Gordon Moore’s 1965 insight.

## *UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE #2: AUTOMATION*

Blitzscaling companies use automation. If they have the ability to perform a task (which is a big if), computers are almost always faster, cheaper, and more reliable than human beings. Furthermore, computers continue to get faster and cheaper, doubling in power every eighteen months according to Moore’s Law, as opposed to human beings, who evolve over the course of millions of years according to Darwin’s principle of natural selection.

In 2014, the journalist Jan Vermeulen compared the original Apple II (introduced in 1977) with the then state-of-the-art iPhone 5S. He found that in the intervening thirty-seven years, Apple’s products had become 2,600 times faster in terms of clock speed (from a 1 MHz single-core CPU to a 1.3 GHz dual-core CPU) and had 16,384 times the amount of RAM. That’s three to four orders of magnitude of improvement in the span of a single human generation. And that massive delta doesn’t even take into account that the Apple II was a desktop computer with a bulky cathode-ray tube monitor, and the iPhone 5S was a portable supercomputer that people carried in their pockets.

The same year that the Apple II was introduced, Joe Bottom set a world record by swimming the 50-meter freestyle in 23.74 seconds, for a brisk pace of just under 7.6 km/h (4.7 mph). If human swimming speed had increased as quickly as the computing speed in Apple’s products, the world record in 2014 would have been 19,700 km/h (12,250 mph)—not quite enough to achieve orbital velocity, but about twenty-five times the speed of the average commercial jetliner. The actual human world record for the 50-meter freestyle in 2014 was 20.91 seconds, for a more modest 11 percent improvement.

That’s the power that automation taps into.

The power of automation applies not just to direct-to-consumer products like the iPhone but also to internal processes and capabilities. Think of the value that automation creates by increasing the productivity in Amazon’s warehouses, or by making it easier to keep Google’s server farms running 24/7.

## *UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE #3: ADAPTATION, NOT OPTIMIZATION*

At a higher level of abstraction, successful scale-ups place more emphasis on adaptation than optimization. Rather than the giant assembly lines of Detroit automakers, which trace their origins to Henry Ford’s Model T, the current generation of Silicon Valley companies practice continuous improvement, whether through an emphasis on speed or the constant experiments and A/B testing of growth hacking. This emphasis makes sense in an environment where companies need to seek product/market fit for new and rapidly changing products and markets. Consider how Amazon expanded into new markets like AWS rather than simply honing its retail capabilities, or how Facebook has been able to adapt to the shift from a text-based social network accessed via desktop Web browsers to an image- and video-based social network accessed via smartphones (and soon, perhaps, VR).

## *UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE #4: THE CONTRARIAN PRINCIPLE*

My friend Peter Thiel has written eloquently about the power of being a contrarian in his book *Zero to One*.

> Whenever I interview someone for a job, I like to ask this question: “What important truth do very few people agree with you on?”
>
> This question sounds easy because it’s straightforward. Actually, it’s very hard to answer. It’s intellectually difficult because the knowledge that everyone is taught in school is by definition agreed upon. And it’s psychologically difficult because anyone trying to answer must say something she knows to be unpopular. Brilliant thinking is rare, but courage is in even shorter supply than genius.

Being contrarian is often critical to the process of creating a massively valuable technology company. As we’ve discussed, key growth factors like distribution and network effects tend to provide disproportionate rewards to a company that is the first in its space to achieve critical scale. Being contrarian and right gives you a huge advantage because you get a head start on achieving scale.

If your company is pursuing an opportunity that nearly everyone agrees is very attractive, you’re likely to have a difficult time distancing yourself from your army of competitors. But if your company is pursuing an opportunity that conventional wisdom ignores or disdains, you will probably have the time you need to refine your business model innovation into a well-oiled machine. Amazon pursued e-commerce when most people didn’t think consumers would feel comfortable using credit cards online. Google launched its search engine when most people thought search was a mature commodity. And Facebook built its social network when most people believed social networking to be either useless, a market dominated by MySpace, or both.

As we’ve already seen, most great ideas look dumb at first. Being contrarian doesn’t mean that dumb people disagree with you; it means that smart people disagree with you! Remember what happened when Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharcyzk tried to pitch Airbnb? Investors like Paul Graham literally couldn’t imagine why people would ever use the service. This doesn’t happen because investors are dumb; most venture capitalists and angel investors are smart, and most smart, successful people would probably agree that investing in proven ideas is better than investing in unproven ones.

The problem is that, by definition, business model innovation involves trying something that is new, and thus unproven!

In this book, we’ve tried to lay out a set of tools, principles, and patterns that you can use to design, invest in, or evaluate an innovative business model. Many venture capitalists like to brag that they are masters of “pattern matching”—but here we must caution not all pattern matching is helpful. The bad kind of pattern matching is what B- and C-grade investors love—the Hollywood high-concept pitch. The movie *Speed* was famous for its high-concept pitch: “*Die Hard* on a bus.” And if you’re the first person to make the connection, you might succeed. *Speed* was in fact a commercial success, mostly because it did in fact live up to its description. But the success of *Speed* led to a raft of derivative and inferior movies, ranging from Steven Seagal’s *Under Siege* (“*Die Hard* on a ship”) to Steven Seagal’s *Executive Decision* (“*Die Hard* on a plane”). When an investor funds “Uber for Pets,” that’s bad pattern matching.

The good kind of pattern matching involves understanding what medical science terms “the mechanism of action.” *Speed* works because confining the action to a bus that has to stay at a certain speed or higher to avoid setting off a bomb creates built-in dramatic tension—especially given the famously bad traffic in Los Angeles. Airbnb works because it has a large market, because travelers spreading awareness from city to city creates virality, and because it follows the proven pattern of an online marketplace.

To help you get a feel for applying our principles of business model innovation, let’s practice by analyzing some of today’s great businesses and how they follow those principles.

# ANALYZING A FEW BILLION-DOLLAR BUSINESS MODELS

## *CASE #1: LINKEDIN*

When we started LinkedIn in 2002, the recent dot-com bust had led most people to consider the consumer Internet industry to be dead. The last thing venture capitalists were willing to do was provide millions of dollars to fund rapid growth. Despite this fact, I thought there was a big opportunity available, and was able to guide LinkedIn through the start-up growth phase until we could raise the capital to really blitzscale.

This is the story of how it happened.

### *Market Size*

The key insight behind LinkedIn was that the Internet was shifting from anonymous cyberspace to an extension of the real world, and thus your online identity was an extension of your real identity. Readers of my generation might remember the famous *New Yorker* cartoon with the caption “On the Internet, nobody knows you’re a dog.” I didn’t think this kind of anonymity would work in a professional context, hence the need for a professional online identity. And though our thesis was contrarian at the time, my cofounders and I were fairly confident that the market of “all white-collar professionals” was sufficiently large to represent a major opportunity.

### *Distribution*

In order to raise money to scale LinkedIn, we had to find a way to prove our distribution strategy. Unfortunately, investors thought of us as “Friendster for business relationships,” which was bad pattern matching and made about as much sense to them as “Tinder for business relationships” would to today’s VCs. Instead, we had to find a way to use the money and reputation I had acquired by helping build PayPal to get LinkedIn to the point where people would invest.

The first step was to assemble a small, super-scrappy team. We got our first office by squatting in the building of a friend’s failing start-up. “Just clean up after yourselves so we can get the lease deposit back, and you can use it for three months,” he told me. I leveraged my reputation to secure a small investment, but I knew we needed to show significant progress in distribution before we could raise our next round. Since we didn’t have the capital to pay for traditional marketing, we implemented a number of techniques similar to what people today call “growth hacking” to get to one million users, which allowed us to raise money from Greylock.

Our core distribution strategy was organic virality, much as it had been at PayPal. Our users would invite their contacts via e-mail because it helped them build their networks and keep track of their key connections. But the initial level of virality simply wasn’t enough. We couldn’t offer PayPal’s kind of financial incentives, so instead we built things like the e-mail address book importer so that we could increase the number of invitations and let our users know when their contacts joined the service.

### *Gross Margins*

Gross margins were important because it became apparent that our user growth was always going to be surpassed by that of the leading consumer social networks. At this point, MySpace had eclipsed Friendster, and Facebook was quickly gaining on MySpace—and all of them had far more users than LinkedIn. Our argument was that our professional users were far more valuable, but to prove that argument we had to demonstrate our ability to earn significant high-margin revenues.

The first business model pattern we tried was a freemium subscription service. The free LinkedIn.com service limited the number of requests a user could send to friends of friends (InMails), and when users hit those limits, they would be offered the chance to upgrade to a premium subscription. This subscription revenue was enough to get us to cash-flow profitability, but it wasn’t growing fast enough to be truly compelling.

The key inflection point came when we discovered that companies were willing to pay for the ability to scan LinkedIn profiles to find the best job candidates. So we offered it to companies as an enterprise subscription product, and once we proved that this new model was a source of significant high-gross-margin revenues, we had the confidence to blitzscale.

### *Network Effects*

The long-term value of LinkedIn was always intended to come from network effects. As a professional social network, LinkedIn leveraged both direct and two-sided network effects, as well as becoming a standard format for presenting one’s professional identity. The direct network effects come from the fact that each additional LinkedIn user makes the network slightly more valuable to all other LinkedIn users. The two-sided network effects occur because more users attract more corporate employers, while more employers increase the value of LinkedIn as a passive job-hunting tool. Finally, by becoming an integral part of most people’s professional online identities, LinkedIn has become a standard that has largely replaced the traditional résumé. Just one of these network effects would probably be enough to create first-scaler advantage; all three working together built a massive strategic moat that protected the LinkedIn business from any new entrants, and even from attempts by consumer networks like Facebook to take away the professional market.

### *Product/Market Fit*

Finding product/market fit for our enterprise product was the key inflection point in the business. How did we do it? We focused on getting market feedback as quickly as possible. We hired a salesperson, gave him some mock-ups of an enterprise product, and sent him to visit potential customers. It turned out that they all wanted to buy it!

### *Operational Scalability*

Blitzscaling LinkedIn presented two major operational scalability challenges, beyond the obvious one of supporting a global social network with hundreds of millions of users. First, to support the business, we actually had to develop, maintain, and update two different products. Without the consumer product, companies wouldn’t see the value of our enterprise product. Without the enterprise product, we couldn’t make enough money to build a great business. We had to do both. It’s hard to find an engineering expert who would recommend fracturing your product and engineering group to work on two largely separate products, but that’s precisely what we did, despite the inefficiency and messiness.

Second, we had to rapidly scale a salesforce while we were still developing the product they were selling. This took a lot of hard work on the part of LinkedIn’s CEOs, Dan Nye and then Jeff Weiner, and their teams. But where we could, we also used technology to help alleviate scaling constraints. Our “Merlin” tool helped make our salespeople more productive (and thus scalable) by automating much of their manual work. Merlin would analyze usage patterns and tell each salesperson which companies to call, how they were already using LinkedIn, and even create a personalized sales deck for each individual prospect!

## *CASE #2: AMAZON*

### *Market Size*

Jeff Bezos’s original vision for Amazon was to take advantage of unlimited digital shelf space to run a store where a customer could buy literally anything. Amazon began with books because this represented a large enough market with a product amenable to e-commerce (durable, fairly standard sizes, readily available through wholesale distributors). Since then, Amazon has steadily expanded from books into many other verticals, and today very nearly lives up to Bezos’s vision of an “everything store” (though you still can’t buy automobiles on Amazon…yet). Retail is a truly gargantuan market and Amazon has captured an almost unthinkable portion of it and even made its market much bigger by launching Amazon Web Services. Now, in addition to being “the everything store,” Amazon also provides much of the Internet’s computing power, bandwidth, and storage (including for other dominant companies like Netflix).

### *Distribution*

Amazon was one of the first companies to fully grasp the possibilities of the Internet as a distribution platform in creating the first successful affiliate program, Amazon Associates, which incentivizes individuals and owners of other websites to refer customers to Amazon in exchange for a share of the revenues generated. This allows Amazon to turn everyone else’s websites and online communications into a powerful distribution channel. Even today, if you see a book title on the Internet, or in a tweet or an e-mail signature, and you follow that link, you’ll probably find yourself on Amazon’s website via an affiliate link.

### *Gross Margins*

Amazon actually scores fairly poorly on this growth factor, though this is largely a function of the industry rather than being specific to Amazon. Retail is a relatively low-margin business, and Amazon’s devotion to offering low prices further hurts margins. Even today, Amazon’s retail business isn’t profitable (though it probably could be if the health of the company required it; for example, Amazon’s core North American operations are profitable—it’s just that its profits are outweighed by the losses generated by Amazon’s efforts in Asia).

Yet even within Amazon’s retail business, we detect signs that these low gross margins are actually part of a long-term strategy that can generate high gross margins, even on retail sales. It’s no secret that Amazon dominates e-commerce; in 2017, analysts like Slice Intelligence reported that Amazon accounted for 44 percent of US e-commerce sales in 2016, and predicted the figure would be even higher in the future. But what is often overlooked is that Amazon’s retail business consists of two very different units. The first is Amazon’s traditional retail operation, in which Amazon buys products from suppliers and sells them to its customers. The second, far less well-known unit is Amazon’s marketplace, which lets third-party sellers sell their products on Amazon. Those third-party sellers store their inventory in Amazon warehouses and pay Amazon to deliver their products to their customers. If you’ve ever shopped on Amazon, you’ve probably bought a product from a third-party seller; Jeff Bezos has said that almost 50 percent of units purchased on Amazon come from them. Because this marketplace business doesn’t require tying up Amazon’s capital in inventory (it ties up the third-party sellers’ capital instead), its gross margins likely resemble high-margin eBay’s more than it does low-margin Walmart’s. As Benchmark’s Matt Cohler notes, “I sometimes wonder if Amazon’s owned-inventory business is just a marketing loss leader and a capital-intensive competitive moat.”

Where Amazon is already tapping into high gross margins is with its AWS business. Remember, 150 percent of its operating margins in 2016 came from AWS, which accounted for $12.2 billion in revenue and over $3 billion in operating income. The high gross margins of AWS allow Amazon to invest heavily in maintaining its lead over its competitors. Indeed, AWS is estimated to hold over 40 percent of the market for cloud computing infrastructure, more than its three biggest rivals—Microsoft, Google, and IBM—put together!

### *Network Effects*

Amazon is relatively weak on network effects. One customer’s use of Amazon doesn’t make it more valuable for another customer, with the possible exception of Amazon’s product reviews. Yet whatever direct network effects exist because of product reviews pales in comparison to the impact of network effects on something like Facebook. Amazon technically is a marketplace with two-sided network effects, thanks to its third-party sellers, but one side is largely missing: Amazon sellers are attracted by Amazon’s massive customer base, but Amazon’s customer base is largely indifferent to those sellers. Amazon does benefit from scale effects, and explicitly uses the “flywheel” framework of author and strategy guru Jim Collins. Brad Stone summarized this approach in his book on Amazon, *The Everything Store*:

> Lower prices led to more customer visits. More customers increased the volume of sales and attracted more commission-paying third-party sellers to the site. That allowed Amazon to get more out of fixed costs like the fulfillment centers and the servers needed to run the website. This greater efficiency then enabled it to lower prices further. Feed any part of this flywheel, they reasoned, and it should accelerate the loop.

Yet as impressive as Amazon’s flywheel is, when compared with the powerful superlinear effect of most network effects, it is merely linear or sublinear. Fortunately, Amazon does benefit from strong network effects in one of its units.

Most of Amazon’s network effects, like most of its gross margins, come from its AWS business. The AWS platform benefits from both indirect network effects and compatibility and standards. The success of AWS encourages developers and development products like Docker to rely on it as their infrastructure of choice, which makes AWS even more successful (while the emergence of AWS as a standard makes it easier for services built on the platform to connect via API).

### *Product/Market Fit*

Amazon has rarely struggled with product/market fit in its core business. For the most part, because it was tapping into an existing—and thriving—retail market, Amazon was able to leap into hypergrowth almost immediately. Even AWS met with rapid uptake, helped by Amazon’s savvy decision to lead with its simplest product, S3 (Simple Storage Service), before expanding to more complicated ones. It is important to remember that Amazon has had many failures outside its core business. Amazon’s powerful core retail operations didn’t allow it to take over auctions or payments from eBay or PayPal, and its Fire Phone was a costly and fruitless attempt to take on Apple and Android.

### *Operational Scalability*

Amazon has managed operational scalability so well that it might be the best in the world at this task.

On the human side, Jeff Bezos has been able to guide Amazon with a strong and steady hand while allowing business leaders like Andy Jassy, the CEO of AWS, or Jeff Wilke, the global head of the consumer business, to run large portions of the company. This delegation has allowed Amazon to grow to over 541,900 employees as of 2017, making it one of the ten largest employers in the United States.

On the infrastructure side, Amazon has deftly shifted from minimizing infrastructure spending, as it did during its early years by using techniques such as outsourcing logistics to book distributors like Ingram, to becoming one of the world’s great infrastructure companies. Amazon is so good at infrastructure that its fastest-growing and most profitable business (AWS) is all about allowing other companies to leverage Amazon’s computing infrastructure. Amazon also makes money by offering Fulfillment by Amazon to other merchants who envy its mastery of logistics, which ought to strike fear into the hearts of frenemies like UPS and FedEx. In addition to its eighty-six gigantic fulfillment centers, Amazon also has at least fifty-eight Prime Now hubs in major markets, allowing it to beat UPS and FedEx on performance by offering same-day delivery of purchases in less than two hours. Amazon has also built out “sortation” centers that let it beat UPS and FedEx on price by shipping small packages via the United States Postal Service for about $1 rather than paying FedEx or UPS around $4.50.

## *CASE #3: GOOGLE*

### *Market Size*

Google’s market size was dramatically underestimated at the outset. When Google came on the scene, many considered it “yet another search engine” in a market that was already dominated by companies like Yahoo! and Lycos. Even in the unlikely event that Google was able to capture a significant share of the search market, it would still be a niche player in comparison to, say, Yahoo!, which was a portal with major properties like Yahoo! Mail and Yahoo! Finance.

Observers failed to realize two things. First, Google’s business model innovation—the relevance-based, revenue-maximizing, self-service advertising system of AdWords—allowed it to generate far more revenue per search than its predecessors. Second, the importance of search was growing at a faster rate than the Internet as a whole. As the Internet grew and the amount of content increased at a superlinear rate, so did the difficulty of filtering and finding relevant information, making search increasingly important. Combine that effect with the rapid growth of the Internet itself, and the result was a massive market.

Google has astutely expanded the market since then by leveraging the power of its business model to make and monetize key acquisitions like Android, Google Maps, and YouTube.

### *Distribution*

Google’s technology receives most of the credit for the company’s success, and it is impressive. However, this means that Google’s skillful use of the distribution growth factor is often overlooked.

To go from “yet another search engine” to “the last search engine” (as my old friend Peter Thiel put it in his 2014 Stanford lecture “Competition Is for Losers”), Google had to leverage a series of existing networks and partners. For example, Google’s bold deal to power AOL’s search results helped the company grow its search business by orders of magnitude. Later, other distribution bets like the Firefox partnership, the acquisition of Android, and the creation of the Chrome browser all paid off and helped maintain Google’s distribution dominance.

Google also found ways to leverage small partners as well, with its AdSense program for Web publishers feeding more raw traffic into the AdWords machine.

### *Gross Margins*

Google is a phenomenally profitable company, with an enviable margin of 61 percent in 2016. But this profitability didn’t happen by accident or luck; the credit belongs to Google’s AdWords business model. As we discussed in our section on business model patterns, the advertising-supported media model hasn’t worked for the Internet. Yet when Google first emerged, this was the dominant business model being pursued by major players like Yahoo! and Lycos. Google adopted the self-service advertising auction model of Overture, added its own refinement of selecting ads based on considerations of relevance and quality as well as bid prices, and pursued a business model of capturing purchase intent rather than just gathering eyeballs. This purchase intent proved to be far more valuable per unit of traffic, enabling Google to earn fat margins.

Google has since used the financial power of its gross margins to place big bets that other companies might shy away from, such as investing in Android and Chrome, two products that were going up against dominant competitors (Apple’s iOS in mobile phone software and Microsoft and Firefox in Web browsers). Google has also used its margins to fund radical experiments like X (formerly Google X) and Waymo (self-driving cars). These bets may or may not pay off, but even if they fail, Google’s margins give it the ability to recover quickly and keep going.

### *Network Effects*

Google has leveraged network effects quite a bit in its major business lines, though not, ironically enough, in its core search product!

The mobile traffic app Waze is a classic example of a direct network effect. Waze harnesses each user’s location to create a more accurate model of traffic conditions, while also letting drivers easily report events such as traffic accidents, speed traps, and stopped cars on the side of the road. Then Waze makes all that data public to everyone using the app. In other words, the more Wazers on the road, the more accurate that road information becomes. Each additional user creates value for all the previous users.

The Android mobile operating system is a classic example of indirect network effects. Its broad adoption by end users increases the incentives for developers to create Android versions of their applications. The increased availability of useful apps encourages more people to use devices that run on the plaftorm.

YouTube is a classic example of two-sided network effects. YouTube brings together video creators and consumers—the more content is created, the more people show up to consume it. The more consumers who show up, the more incentive there is to create content.

Finally, Google’s G Suite provides a great example of the power of compatibility and standards (ironically enough, much like Microsoft Office, its archrival) as well as local network effects. When users share Google Docs or Google Sheets with others, they lock in anyone who wants to collaborate on those documents to do the same. This is especially common in individual networks like a project team or school. Once some of the school’s teachers start using Google Docs for homework assignments, the pressure builds for all of them to standardize on Google Docs, and for children and parents to adopt it as well. Chris speaks from experience here.

### *Product/Market Fit*

Google got the product/market fit for its core search and AdWords product incredibly right. Even from the start, Google’s search results were better than those of its competitors. But many people don’t realize that it actually took Google a long time to find the right product for the right market. Google started off trying to sell enterprise search appliances, a tool that sits inside a corporate data center, indexing content stored on a company’s servers, then offering a Google search box to find items within that content. Next, Google tried the advertising-supported model by running DoubleClick ads; ironically enough, Google would later buy DoubleClick. Fortunately, Google found product/market fit by refining Overture’s advertising auction model. Google’s AdWords product was so much better at monetizing search through its self-service, relevance-driven, auction system that by the time those competitors managed to play catch-up, Google had amassed the financial resources that allowed it to invest whatever was necessary to maintain product superiority.

Google doesn’t always get product/market fit right (and if it had run out of money before hitting upon AdWords, the search business might have died before ever achieving that fit). This is a reflection of its very intentional product management philosophy, which relies on bottom-up innovation and a high tolerance for failure. When it works, as in Gmail, which was a bottom-up project launched by Paul Buchheit, it can produce killer products. But when it fails, it results in *killed* products, as demonstrated by projects like Buzz, Wave, and Glass. To overcome this risk of failure, Google relies on both its financial strength (which comes from its high gross margins, among other things) and a willingness to decisively cut its losses. For example, when Google bought YouTube (which had clearly achieved product/market fit), it was willing to abandon its own Google Video service, even though it had invested heavily in that product.

Other massively successful companies take a very different approach. In contrast to Google, where new ideas can come from anywhere in the company and there are always many parallel projects going on at the same time, Apple takes a top-down approach that puts more wood behind fewer arrows. Apple keeps its product lines small and tends to work on a single major product at a time. One philosophy isn’t necessarily better than the other; the important thing is simply to find that product/market fit quickly, before your competition does.

### *Operational Scalability*

Unsurprisingly for an engineering-driven organization, Google excels in operational scalability. For one thing, its heavy investment in its own tools and infrastructure has allowed its engineering organization to fine-tune its infrastructure for high performance as the company has grown.

Google has innovated in people scalability as well. While most of Google’s people management practices are smart but relatively straightforward—for example, Google uses smaller teams to work on new products and larger teams to sustain and grow existing products—Google has invested heavily in people analytics and data to determine things like the optimum number of interviews per candidate (no more than five) and to improve practices for recruitment, performance reviews, and so on.

## *CASE #4: FACEBOOK*

### *Market Size*

Market size is one of the key reasons that many failed to appreciate the potential value of Facebook in its early days. At the time, the elevator pitch for Facebook would have been “social network for college students.” This description, which combined a new and unproven product category with a specific (and narrow) audience, made Facebook sound like a niche product. But by the time I invested in Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg’s vision was far broader and more valuable. Mark wanted Facebook to be the default way that people stayed in touch with their friends, which was and is an enormous market. Of course, even when Mark pitched his broader vision, many investors didn’t believe him, much to their later regret.

### *Distribution*

Facebook excelled at distribution. As noted earlier, Facebook’s early focus on college students, which caused some to dismiss it as a niche product, was actually part of an extremely successful distribution strategy. To achieve incredible virality, Facebook would deliberately delay launching at a college campus until over 50 percent of the students had requested it so that local critical mass was reached almost immediately.

Facebook further benefited from leveraging existing friend networks to expand outward from its original college user base. As users experienced the benefits of staying connected via Facebook, they naturally wanted to add their off-line friends to the network.

### *Gross Margins*

Like Google, Facebook started its life without an effective revenue model. But once it discovered the value of sponsored posts within a news feed, Facebook was able to become wildly profitable. About 90 percent of Facebook’s revenue today comes from advertising sales, and the company achieves an astounding 87 percent gross margin.

This gross margin allows Facebook to invest heavily in talent and technology. It has also allowed Mark Zuckerberg to make canny (and expensive) acquisitions, like Instagram and WhatsApp, to become a dominant player in mobile as well as desktop social networks, and also long-term future bets like Oculus.

### *Network Effects*

We’ve already talked about how Facebook leverages classic direct network effects (the more users that join the platform, the greater the value of Facebook to every other Facebook user) and local network effects (once it becomes the dominant social network at a college, it becomes extremely difficult for any other player to pry away Facebook’s users).

Facebook also experiences some helpful indirect network effects thanks to its platform services, such as the Graph API (which allows developers to leverage the Facebook social graph of users and their relationships) and Facebook Connect (which allows users to log in to a Web service using Facebook rather than create a new account for that service).

### *Product/Market Fit*

Facebook achieved product/market fit for its core consumer experience almost immediately, hence its rapid growth. However, part of what makes Facebook a great company and Mark Zuckerberg a great CEO is that Facebook has been able to achieve product/market fit in additional and less obvious areas at other points in the company’s history.

Many people forget how Facebook struggled with the transition from desktop to mobile. Facebook’s initial mobile product provided a slow, suboptimal experience, and adoption of that product was accordingly slow. Fortunately for Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg saw that the market was going mobile and put a moratorium on new feature development in order to focus the entire team on building a new, far superior mobile product. In parallel, he also moved quickly and decisively to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp; when they were announced, both acquisitions were considered pricey, but in hindsight they were clearly bargains. Today, Facebook has over 1.7 billion active mobile users each month, and mobile advertising accounts for 81 percent of the company’s advertising revenue. Over 56 percent of Facebook users access the service exclusively via mobile.

Equally important was Facebook’s ability to achieve product/market fit for its advertisers. When Facebook began, the conventional wisdom was that user-generated content like Facebook would never be able to attract advertisers, who would not want their brands appearing with poor-quality or even inappropriate content. Google’s search model was what worked in online advertising. Facebook was able to overturn the conventional wisdom by developing algorithms to block inappropriate content, and by learning from Twitter’s sponsored update model and incorporating ads into the Facebook News Feed. The news feed model has been especially effective for monetizing mobile usage. In a return to what worked in the print world, advertisements are intermixed with content, and as you page through the magazine or scroll through the feed, you encounter advertisements as part of your normal flow, as opposed to the interruptions of pop-up or takeover ads, or the easily ignored static placement of the traditional banner ad. Yet Facebook’s News Feed is even better for advertisers than a magazine, because Facebook’s core social actions (clicking, liking, sharing) train users to engage with whatever appears in the News Feed, including advertisements!

### *Operational Scalability*

How did Facebook successfully overcome the growth limiter of operational scalability? On the technology side, one of the philosophies that helped Facebook become successful was its famous motto “Move fast and break things.” This emphasis on speed, which came directly from Mark Zuckerberg, allowed Facebook to achieve rapid product development and continuous product improvement. Even today, every new software engineer who joins Facebook is asked to make a revision to the Facebook codebase (potentially affecting millions or even billions of users) on his or her first day of work. However, as Facebook’s user base and engineering team grew to a massive size, Mark had to change the philosophy to “Move fast and break things with stable infrastructure.”

While this new motto might seem self-contradictory, Mark explains that it focuses on a higher-level goal. “The goal is to move fast,” Mark told me. “When we were smaller, being willing to break things allowed us to move faster. But as we grew, the willingness to break things actually started slowing us down, because increasing complexity made it harder and harder to fix things once they broke. By taking the extra time to focus on stable infrastructure, we reduce the impact and time to recover from breaking things, so that we can actually move faster.”

# WHAT COMES AFTER A STRONG, PROVEN BUSINESS MODEL?

If you believe you’ve designed a business model that can support massive growth and value creation, the next step is to decide on your strategy. That’s where strategy innovation comes in.`,
		half: `In Part II of the discussion on Business Model Innovation, it's clear that formulating an innovative business model is crucial for exponential growth, particularly in the Internet era. The dot-com boom of the late 1990s illustrated that simply transplanting existing business models onto the online medium often led to failure. Giants like Microsoft and Time Warner, as well as start-ups like eToys, faltered because they didn't adapt their models to the new medium. However, innovative business models propelled companies like Amazon, eBay, and Google to massive success. These companies redefined their industries with novel strategies—Amazon revolutionized e-commerce, Google monetized search, and Facebook changed social networking. Technological innovation alone wasn't enough; success required innovative products and services underpinned by innovative business models. The narrative underscores that a viable business model must generate financial returns, scale rapidly, and create a sustainable competitive edge, with companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook exemplifying these principles. The text concludes by emphasizing that while there is no one-size-fits-all business model, most successful ones share traits that maximize growth and minimize limits, highlighting the importance of market size as a key growth factor.

The most basic growth factor for your business model is market size, a fundamental concept for start-ups covered in Pitch Deck 101. If you aim to build a massive company, start by dismissing ideas that target too small of a market. A big market doesn't just mean a large number of potential customers; it also includes efficient channels to reach them. For instance, “everyone in the world” is a large market, but not easily accessible. This complexity in determining market size, or total available market (TAM), creates uncertainty in blitzscaling. However, correctly predicting TAM and investing when others are hesitant can lead to high returns, as demonstrated by Airbnb and Uber. A quickly growing market, even if initially small, can offer tremendous potential and make a sizable market even more appealing.

In Silicon Valley, the fierce competition for venture capital forces entrepreneurs to target large markets to promise substantial returns. Venture capital firms, funding through millions or even billions from entities like pension funds and university endowments, seek high returns that necessitate tripling their investments over a typical span of seven to ten years. This requires VCs to rely on a few exceptionally successful investments, such as Benchmark Capital's $6.7 million investment in eBay in 1997, which returned $5 billion, or a 745 times return. Consequently, VCs focus on ventures that can achieve "venture scale" of at least $1 billion in annual sales, often passing on smaller but otherwise viable businesses. Sam Altman advised Airbnb's Brian Chesky to project a market size in line with their ambitious vision, increasing their pitch from $30 million to $30 billion, which was more accurate. Companies like Uber exemplify this, surpassing initial market estimates through appealing innovations and expanding user bases. Similarly, Amazon's evolution from a bookstore to "the everything store" showcases how market expansion boosts a company's reach and profitability beyond initial projections.

Apple's financial results underscore the importance of distribution in sustaining and scaling a business. In Q1 2017, Apple's personal computer sales hit $7.2 billion, but this made up less than 10% of their $78.4 billion total revenue. As Greylock’s Jerry Chen observes, scaling requires a clear path from modest beginnings to massive outputs. Crucially, effective distribution is often more decisive for success than product quality alone. Dropbox thrived not just because of its great product but due to stellar distribution, a sentiment echoed by its CEO, Drew Houston, who finds many start-ups overlook this. In today’s mobile-first era, distributing apps is more challenging, necessitating innovative methods to reach broad audiences without hefty costs. This has led successful companies like Instagram and WhatsApp to utilize two main distribution strategies: leveraging existing networks and harnessing virality.

When I was at PayPal, distributing our payment service through eBay was a game-changer. By 2000, eBay had ten million registered users, and we leveraged this by creating software that automatically added a “Pay with PayPal” button to eBay listings. This was a hit despite eBay's own Billpoint service, which sellers had to add manually. Similarly, Airbnb, on advice from Y Combinator’s Michael Seibel, successfully tapped into Craigslist by developing technology to seamlessly repost Airbnb listings to the classifieds site, significantly boosting host earnings. This integration was notable because Craigslist lacked an API, making it a technological marvel focused on innovative distribution rather than product changes. However, leveraging existing networks can backfire. Zynga thrived by integrating with Facebook but had to adapt when Facebook restricted game-related posts. Fortunately, Zynga's founder, Mark Pincus, had built a resilient franchise. In contrast, content farms like Demand Media, which relied on Google's search algorithms for traffic, struggled and failed when Google adjusted its algorithms to sideline what it considered “junk” content.

Despite the inherent risks, utilizing existing networks can be crucial for business models, particularly when these networks act as a “booster rocket” that can later be enhanced with virality or network effects.

“Viral” distribution means existing users of a product bring more users, creating a ripple effect similar to how a virus spreads. This virality can happen naturally or through incentives. After launching LinkedIn, our focus was on enhancing organic virality, such as making it easier for users to invite friends via address book import tools, like connecting LinkedIn to Outlook contacts. Unexpectedly, users began using their LinkedIn profiles as their professional online identity, boosting viral growth when others sought to do the same. At PayPal, combining organic and incentivized virality proved effective, with monetary rewards for referrals helping drive rapid growth. Similarly, Dropbox used organic sharing and storage incentives to expand quickly, learning the importance of user retention through rigorous usability testing and refining the user experience. Virality generally suits free or freemium models, and combining organic and incentivized strategies can be powerful, as evidenced by Facebook's college-by-college rollout. Additionally, high gross margins, especially in high-tech businesses, are crucial for funding growth, since they allow more cash flow for expansion due to minimal costs of goods sold, as seen in software and SaaS companies.

In contrast to low-margin "old economy" businesses like agriculture, retail, and food service, Amazon's success in the typically low-margin retail industry is noteworthy, though it now heavily relies on its high-margin Amazon Web Services (AWS). In 2016, AWS accounted for 150 percent of Amazon’s operating income, highlighting retail losses. Most valuable companies have gross margins exceeding 60 percent, such as Google (61%) and Facebook (87%). Amazon's gross margin was 35 percent, higher than General Electric's 27 percent. High gross margins attract investors because they prefer businesses where higher revenues yield higher profit margins, facilitating easier fundraising and lower capital costs. Blitzscalers like Amazon and Xiaomi often prioritize market share over gross margins, with investors valuing potential gross margins over realized ones. High gross margins make it easier to cover operational costs like customer support and fuel faster growth. Lastly, network effects have been instrumental in transforming the most valuable companies from traditional industrial and consumer firms to tech giants like Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook, driven by the rise of the Internet and global connectivity.

In our highly interconnected world, companies can achieve extraordinary growth and profitability by harnessing network effects. For simplicity, we’ll define network effects in layman's terms in this book.

A product or service benefits from positive network effects when increased usage enhances its value for all users, creating a "demand-side economy of scale" or "positive externality." These effects generate a positive feedback loop, leading to superlinear growth and value creation. This makes it tough for any node (often customers or users, such as those in fax machine or Facebook networks) to switch to an alternative, resulting in "customer lock-in." This phenomenon often leads to "increasing returns to scale," where one product or company dominates the market and reaps the majority of profits. It's no wonder that smart entrepreneurs and investors are keen on network-effects-based start-ups like eBay, Facebook, and Airbnb. To achieve dominance, understanding and designing network effects into business models is crucial. My colleague Simon Rothman, a leading expert on network effects, cautions against merely adding superficial features like profiles. Instead, true blitzscalers study and implement various types of network effects. NYU professor Arun Sundararajan categorizes these into five broad types on his industrial organization of information technology website.

**Direct Network Effects:** Usage directly increases value. (Examples: Facebook, WeChat, WhatsApp)

**Indirect Network Effects:** Usage promotes complementary goods, boosting the original product’s value. (Example: OS adoption like Windows, iOS, or Android encourages third-party app development, enhancing platform value.)

**Two-Sided Network Effects:** Usage by one user group enhances value for another. (Example: Marketplaces like eBay, Uber, Airbnb)

**Local Network Effects:** Usage by a small user subset increases value for connected users. (Example: Metered call carriers allowing “favorites” with unlimited calls.)

**Compatibility and Standards:** One product’s use encourages compatible product use. (Example: Word’s dominance turned its format into the standard, leading to the decline of competitors like WordPerfect.)

Network Effects Produce and Require Aggressive Growth: The importance of network effects means businesses must aggressively grow and adopt their networks. The impact increases superlinearly; at low scales, network effects dampen user adoption. Companies must hit a “tipping point” where supply meets demand for the product to have value. Businesses like Uber subsidize customers to reach this tipping point quickly. During my time at PayPal, we initially offered free credit card payments to attract users. This tactic led to significant losses, forcing us to charge fees eventually, but our loyal customers accepted the change. For free services like Facebook, shaping user expectations can enhance perceived service value, encouraging adoption. Geoffrey Moore’s *Crossing the Chasm* highlights the difficulty tech companies face transitioning from early adopters to the mainstream. Moore suggests focusing on niche markets and using them as beachheads to expand. This strategy is vital for network effects businesses. Designing products valuable to individual users, regardless of network adoption, reshapes the demand curve. LinkedIn profiles, for instance, provided value independent of network size, by serving as online professional identities. Connectivity fuels Network Effects Businesses.

In today's hyper-connected world, the ease of reaching the tipping point for network effects has significantly increased, supporting and sustaining the network effects that drive market dominance. This high connectivity not only fosters network effects but also helps maintain their influence, ensuring lasting market control.

The Internet has significantly reduced the cost of product and service discovery, allowing companies with a competitive edge to rapidly scale through network effects, resulting in winner-take-all markets. Online platforms like Amazon and Google help popular products rise to the top, and the power of distribution has become crucial to reaching a tipping point. In the Networked Age, companies can avoid traditional growth barriers, such as overhead from rapid organizational expansion, by leveraging networks, as Apple did with Foxconn. This scalability allows tech giants like Google to continue growing at high rates and invest in future innovations, effectively moving from one product S-curve to another, like Apple transitioning from music players to smartphones. Network effects, while not universal, are integral to Silicon Valley's success, driven by a culture of business model innovation. Successful entrepreneurs design business models that leverage these effects for rapid growth, as seen with Craigslist. The concept of "blitzscaling" helps startups reach a tipping point faster, but overcoming growth limiters like product/market fit and operational scalability is essential. Product/market fit, a concept emphasized by Marc Andreessen, involves finding a nonobvious market opportunity that companies can dominate. Entrepreneurs are encouraged to use network intelligence to validate their ideas, though true product/market fit is ultimately proven by user adoption. On the other hand, operational scalability is crucial for handling explosive growth, and designing models that address human limitations and logistical challenges can prevent high-class problems from hindering success.

Managing a small founding team of four requires overseeing relationships between six pairs, but increasing the team to six members escalates the number of relationships to fifteen pairs, a 150% rise in complexity. This exponential increase underscores the challenges of operational scalability as team size grows. One solution is to adopt a business model that minimizes the need for a large workforce. For instance, WhatsApp founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton leveraged a freemium model and network effects to grow rapidly with just forty-three employees, achieving a ratio of over ten million users per employee. Another strategy is outsourcing, exemplified by Airbnb's initiative to enhance listing photos through freelance photographers, which evolved from manual efforts by founders to automated management of a global network. Despite these strategies, sustaining long-term success typically necessitates a substantial workforce, though innovative management techniques can help companies navigate this growth. Future discussions will delve into these innovations and how they support scaling operations.

The other major challenge of operational scalability arises from the pressure of expanding the nonhuman infrastructure of a business. No matter how much demand you drum up, it's pointless if your infrastructure can't support it. These limitations can be fatal to a company’s ambitions, as illustrated by the social networks Friendster and Twitter.

Friendster, the first mainstream online social network before Facebook, launched in March 2003, quickly amassing millions of users. Its founder, Jonathan Abrams, even appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! However, the rapid growth overwhelmed Friendster's infrastructure, leading to long load times, which allowed MySpace to eclipse it by 2005. MySpace, however, eventually lost to Facebook. Twitter faced similar struggles with its famous "Fail Whale" error during high-traffic events such as Michael Jackson's death in 2009 and the 2010 World Cup, but managed to rearchitect its systems, overcoming these issues by the 2012 US presidential election. A significant factor behind the recent surge in web company growth has been Amazon Web Services (AWS), which has enabled companies like Dropbox to scale their infrastructure efficiently without building their own.

AWS exemplifies how Amazon has turned operational scalability into a competitive advantage by leveraging "the power of modularity," a concept articulated by Carliss Baldwin and Kim Clark in their book, *Design Rules, Vol 1: The Power of Modularity*. This principle allows Amazon and its customers to create complex products from smaller, standardized components, not just in software but across its business, enhancing flexibility and adaptability. On the hardware side, China plays a similar role, enabling hardware start-ups to rapidly scale by utilizing its manufacturing capabilities. For instance, Nest managed to grow efficiently with only 130 employees by outsourcing manufacturing, leading to its $3 billion acquisition by Google. Conversely, Tesla Motors has faced growth limitations due to its intricate manufacturing process, resulting in slower production rates and long back orders, highlighting the challenge of scaling to meet high demand despite having an award-winning product.

Whether by design or not, rapidly growing companies often follow proven patterns that leverage growth factors and circumvent growth limiters. While these patterns will be detailed further below, it's crucial to recognize that they are principles, not exact recipes. Adopting these patterns alone won't guarantee an innovative business model, but comprehending them equips entrepreneurs with a set of valuable role models.

Not all business models produce massively profitable businesses, despite following proven patterns. For example, open-source software, which emerged during the dot-com era and has significantly impacted the technology stack, exemplifies business model innovation through free, community-created software. It captures a large market, benefits from network effects, and utilizes distributed volunteer contributions, avoiding scalability issues linked to large employee organizations. However, even Red Hat, the most successful open-source business with a $15 billion market cap after two decades, shows that while open source drives engagement, it doesn't generate massive profits. To qualify as a proven pattern, a model must demonstrate that multiple businesses can achieve significant value with it. Therefore, we've compiled a list of such proven patterns to inspire your business model innovations. **PROVEN PATTERN #1: BITS RATHER THAN ATOMS**.

### The Power of Bits, Platforms, and Freemium Models

Google and Facebook exemplify bits-based businesses, focusing on electronic bits rather than physical atoms, which makes it easier for them to serve a global market and achieve large scales. Such businesses benefit from high gross margins due to lower variable costs and can innovate rapidly through continuous iteration. This is illustrated by WhatsApp's small team managing global operations. George Gilder’s 1990 prediction in "Microcosm" about the ascendance of intellectual resources over physical ones was further validated by Marc Andreessen in 2011, highlighting software-driven giants like Amazon, Netflix, and LinkedIn. Platforms have magnified their value exponentially in the Networked Age, achieving immediate global distribution and seamless API-based transactions, thus cementing competitive advantages through network effects. Dominant platforms like iTunes, Amazon, and Apple's iOS ecosystem benefit from high-margin revenues that can be reinvested to enhance their offerings. Additionally, the freemium model, supported by behavioral insights from Dan Ariely’s research, unveils how offering products for free can alter consumer choices significantly, driving widespread adoption and long-term engagement.

The remarkable power of offering free products can drive distribution and virality by helping achieve the critical mass needed to unleash network effects, as illustrated by LinkedIn's strategy with free basic accounts. By reaching a significant user base, even free users can be monetized effectively, as demonstrated by Facebook's lucrative targeted advertising revenue. However, when the advertising model isn't suitable, especially for educational services, the freemium model offers a solution. Coined by venture capitalist Fred Wilson in 2006, freemium emerged from the 1980s shareware concept and utilizes a free version to attract users and a paid version to monetize them. Dropbox exemplifies this by offering 2 GB free storage, converting a fraction of users to paid plans for additional storage. Another successful model is marketplaces, with giants like Google, eBay, Alibaba, and Airbnb. These platforms thrive on two-sided network effects, creating liquidity where buyers and sellers can efficiently connect. Once a marketplace achieves this liquidity, it triggers a positive feedback loop, making it difficult for new entrants to capture market share.

Marketplaces offer significant advantages beyond the obvious network effects. By enabling a liquid market where supply and demand dynamically price transactions, they ensure more efficient pricing and greater value creation through more transactions. Illiquid markets, in contrast, often result in mispricing and reduced sales. A prime example is Google’s AdWords marketplace, which allows anyone to bid on targeted keywords, democratizing access to global distribution for even the smallest businesses. This contrasts with traditional advertising, where large clients pay exorbitant sums for TV ads during prime time, like the Super Bowl. Google’s system favors ads that generate the most paid click-throughs, showing consumers the most relevant ads without the overhead of intermediaries. By dealing in virtually unlimited, low-cost ad space, Google increases its gross margin. The Networked Age has amplified the value of marketplaces, allowing them to tap into a global market without the limitations of physical infrastructure, thereby overcoming traditional growth constraints.

When Salesforce.com introduced its on-demand CRM product, many questioned the viability of the SaaS model, which differed significantly from the traditional permanent license and on-premise software approach. SaaS shifted the payment structure to subscriptions and necessitated 24/7 data center support, affecting cash flow and staffing needs. Despite initial concerns, SaaS like Salesforce.com and Workday thrived due to broader market reach and more efficient distribution compared to older, on-premise models. SaaS’s success extends beyond enterprise software, influencing industries like music and video streaming, exemplified by Spotify, Pandora, Netflix, and Hulu, that benefit from lower overhead and predictable revenue. This predictability allows for substantial long-term investment, as seen with Netflix’s $6 billion content investment. Additionally, digital goods have emerged as profitable ventures within SaaS, such as LINE’s sticker sales and in-game purchases in the video game industry, both of which boast high margins and scalability.

One of the most underrated yet powerful patterns is the news feed, which has significantly contributed to the success of companies like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Slack. Facebook's innovation with the news feed has driven user engagement, advertising revenue, and long-term retention, making it a world-class business despite attracting users initially through network effects. The model's success lies in its ability to monetize users' desire for amusement by strategically targeting advertisements based on their interests and engagement history, unlike other feed-based products like RSS readers. This capability has positioned Facebook's News Feed as a leader in online advertising, second only to Google's AdWords, which benefits from capturing active consumer intent. Even Twitter's continued relevance and massive scale can be attributed to the power of the news feed model, underscoring the impact of business model innovation over mere product or technology changes.

Beneath the established patterns of business model innovation lie fundamental principles that not only help refine these patterns but also pave the way for creating new ones. Although these principles are not business models in their own right, they often drive the technological advancements that make business model innovation possible.

### UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE #1: MOORE’S LAW

Moore’s Law, coined by Intel cofounder Gordon Moore, is the principle that has fundamentally driven the success of Silicon Valley and the global tech industry. Initially stated in 1965, it observed the annual doubling of transistors on a silicon chip, later adjusted to every eighteen months. Though it originally referred to transistor density, Moore’s Law now predicts the doubling of computing power every eighteen months, a growth currently fueled by multicore, multithreaded computing. The ultimate limit of Moore’s Law seems to be human ingenuity rather than physics. This principle has consistently spurred technological innovation and business models, transitioning from gigantic mainframes to personal tech like smartphones. It’s seen similar impacts on network bandwidth, advancing the Web from text to multimedia, and potentially, VR in the future. Visionary entrepreneurs like Reed Hastings of Netflix have not just followed Moore’s Law but anticipated its progression. Despite technological limitations in 1997, Hastings foresaw streaming TV via the Internet, initially leveraging DVDs as a bridge to his ultimate vision.

Hastings realized that movie DVDs, then selling for around $20, were compact and durable—perfect for a movie-rental-by-mail business. Inspired by an assignment from a computer science class, he saw how technological innovation could enable a new business model that differed from Blockbuster's VHS tape rentals. VHS tapes, being bulky and fragile, were impractical for mail rental. Instead, Netflix utilized DVDs to offer a subscription service with unlimited movies for $20 per month, avoiding the late fees dreaded by Blockbuster customers. Although Netflix initially hinged on mailing DVDs, Hastings envisioned streaming as the future. Despite underestimating the timeline of streaming’s viability, advancements in computer power and internet bandwidth eventually made on-demand television feasible, transitioning Netflix into a dominant streaming service by 2012. Today, Netflix is synonymous with online television, creating "binge watching" and leveraging its subscription model to fund original content like *Stranger Things* and *Beasts of No Nation*. Unlike traditional TV, which bets on broadly appealing pilots, Netflix’s personalized on-demand service curates content based on viewer habits, ensuring satisfaction and reducing cancellations. This personalized approach, empowered by Hastings' patience with Moore's Law, transformed Netflix into one of the most successful media companies, proving that with persistence, a revolutionary idea can evolve from an improbable vision into reality.

Blitzscaling companies harness the power of automation because, if feasible, computers outperform humans in speed, cost, and reliability. This advantage is further amplified by Moore’s Law, which states that computing power doubles every eighteen months, contrasting human evolution's sluggish pace. For instance, journalist Jan Vermeulen highlighted a staggering improvement between the 1977 Apple II and the 2014 iPhone 5S, noting a 2,600-fold increase in clock speed and 16,384 times more RAM, all within one human generation. To illustrate further, if human athletic performance had matched this growth, swimming speeds would be unfathomably faster; however, actual records show only a modest 11 percent improvement. This disparity underscores the power of automation, which enhances not only consumer products such as the iPhone but also optimizes internal operations in companies like Amazon and Google, driving productivity and efficiency to unprecedented levels.

### UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE #3: ADAPTATION, NOT OPTIMIZATION

At a higher level of abstraction, successful scale-ups prioritize adaptation over optimization. Unlike the static, giant assembly lines of Detroit automakers dating back to Henry Ford’s Model T, modern Silicon Valley companies like Amazon and Facebook embrace continuous improvement and constant experimentation. Amazon, for instance, didn’t just perfect its retail capabilities, but diversified into new markets like AWS. Similarly, Facebook evolved from a text-based social network on desktops to an image- and video-rich platform on smartphones. This adaptive approach is crucial for achieving product/market fit in rapidly changing environments.

### UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE #4: THE CONTRARIAN PRINCIPLE

My friend Peter Thiel eloquently discusses the power of being contrarian in his book *Zero to One*.

Whenever I interview someone for a job, I like to ask, “What important truth do very few people agree with you on?” This question is deceptively simple, posing both intellectual and psychological challenges. The knowledge taught in schools is commonly agreed upon, and stating an unpopular truth requires courage. Contrarian thinking, often crucial for creating valuable technology companies, gives a significant advantage because it allows a company to achieve critical scale without much competition. Examples like Amazon, Google, and Facebook show that their success stemmed from pursuing dismissed opportunities. Being contrarian means smart people disagree with you; remember Airbnb’s founders, who faced skepticism from investors. This happens because innovation involves unproven ideas. In this book, we provide tools to design and evaluate innovative business models, while cautioning against bad pattern matching, like “Uber for Pets.” Effective pattern matching involves understanding mechanisms of action, such as Airbnb’s large market and viral city-to-city growth. Let’s practice analyzing billion-dollar business models using our principles of business model innovation.

Sure, here's the summarized version in markdown:

---

In CASE #1: LINKEDIN, the professional networking giant successfully navigated a complex landscape to become a leading social platform for career-oriented individuals. Distinguishing itself from other social media, LinkedIn focused heavily on creating value through professional engagement and information sharing. The platform's unique selling proposition lies in its capacity to connect users with potential employers, foster industry-specific content, and provide tools for career development. Remarkably, LinkedIn's approach to monetization—such as premium subscriptions and advertising—has been a pivotal aspect of its growth strategy. This model enabled them to build a robust revenue stream while maintaining the core essence of professional networking. By continually evolving and integrating new features tailored to professional needs, LinkedIn has cemented its status as an indispensable tool in the professional world.

When we launched LinkedIn in 2002, the dot-com bust had left many people considering the consumer Internet industry as dead. Venture capitalists were highly reluctant to fund rapid growth with millions of dollars. However, I saw a significant opportunity and managed to steer LinkedIn through the initial start-up growth phase until we could secure the capital needed to truly blitzscale. This is the story of how we made it happen. Market Size.

LinkedIn's foundational insight was recognizing the Internet's shift from anonymous cyberspace to a platform reflecting real-world identities, necessitating a professional online identity. This idea was then unconventional, but my cofounders and I saw a significant opportunity in targeting “all white-collar professionals.” To raise funds for LinkedIn's growth, we needed to demonstrate an effective distribution strategy, but early investors misunderstood us as a "Friendster for business relationships," which was an inaccurate comparison. Leveraging my PayPal reputation, I managed to secure initial investments, and we bootstrapped by setting up in a friend’s failing startup. Our distribution strategy hinged on organic virality, encouraging users to invite their contacts via email to expand their networks, but this alone wasn't sufficient. We innovated with tools like the email address book importer to boost invitations and notify users when their contacts joined, ultimately growing to one million users and securing further investment from Greylock.

Gross margins were crucial for LinkedIn as our user growth couldn’t match the leading social networks like MySpace or Facebook, which had far more users. We argued our professional users were more valuable and needed to demonstrate significant high-margin revenues. Initially, we tried a freemium subscription model, limiting free users' InMail requests and offering premium upgrades, which made us cash-flow profitable but not compellingly so. The game changer came when we realized companies would pay for access to scan LinkedIn profiles for job candidates. This lead us to offer an enterprise subscription product, proving it could generate significant high-gross-margin revenues and gave us the confidence to blitzscale. LinkedIn's long-term value hinged on network effects, leveraging direct and two-sided effects, and becoming a standard for professional identities. Direct effects came from every new user adding value, while two-sided effects attracted more employers, enhancing LinkedIn's job-hunting utility. This combined with LinkedIn becoming integral to professional identities, created a formidable strategic moat. Achieving product/market fit for our enterprise product was pivotal; we quickly got market feedback by hiring a salesperson, equipped with mock-ups, to engage potential customers who all wanted to buy it.

At LinkedIn, we encountered two major operational scalability challenges during our blitzscaling phase. The first was the need to develop, maintain, and update both a consumer product and an enterprise product simultaneously, since each was essential for the success of the other. This unconventional and inefficient approach required significant effort from our engineering team. The second challenge was the rapid scaling of our salesforce, even as the product they were selling was still under development. This huge task was managed by our CEOs, Dan Nye and later Jeff Weiner, along with their teams. To ease the scaling process, we utilized technology like our "Merlin" tool, which made sales operations more efficient by automating tasks. Merlin helped salespeople by analyzing usage patterns, recommending which companies to contact, detailing their use of LinkedIn, and generating personalized sales decks.

Jeff Bezos’s ambition for Amazon was to exploit the limitless space of digital shelves to create a store where customers could purchase virtually anything. Starting with books, a substantial market with products ideal for e-commerce due to their durability, standard sizes, and wholesale distribution availability, Amazon has successfully diversified into numerous other categories. Today, it almost achieves Bezos’s “everything store” vision, though cars are still an exception. Retail, being a massive market, has enabled Amazon to seize a substantial share, further expanded by the creation of Amazon Web Services (AWS), which supplies much of the Internet’s computing power, bandwidth, and storage, even for giants like Netflix. Amazon innovatively leveraged the Internet as a distribution platform by initiating the first effective affiliate program, Amazon Associates, turning numerous third-party websites into strong distribution channels. Despite struggling with low gross margins—common in the retail industry and exacerbated by Amazon’s commitment to low prices—Amazon remains financially viable, with profitable North American operations, though these are offset by losses in Asia.

Amazon's retail business, despite low gross margins, seems to be part of a long-term strategy geared towards high gross margins. Dominating e-commerce, with 44% of US sales in 2016, Amazon's retail operations are split into traditional retail and a lesser-known marketplace for third-party sellers. The marketplace, where sellers use Amazon's logistics for a fee, resembles high-margin eBay more than low-margin Walmart. Jeff Bezos highlighted that nearly 50% of purchases come from third-party sellers. The retail side might act as a loss leader, contrasted by the high-margin AWS, which in 2016 generated over $3 billion in operating income and captured more than 40% of the cloud infrastructure market. While Amazon's network effects are weaker compared to platforms like Facebook, its "flywheel" model driving economies of scale is effective, though linear compared to the superlinear network effects. AWS benefits significantly from network effects, standardization, and compatibility, bolstering its success. Historically, Amazon has rarely struggled with product/market fit in its core businesses, swiftly achieving hypergrowth. However, it has seen notable failures outside its core, such as the Fire Phone. Operational scalability remains an area where Amazon excels, arguably leading globally.

Jeff Bezos' leadership has allowed Amazon to flourish by empowering leaders like Andy Jassy, CEO of AWS, and Jeff Wilke, global head of consumer business, to manage vast parts of the company, contributing to Amazon's growth to over 541,900 employees by 2017. Initially minimizing infrastructure costs by outsourcing logistics, Amazon transformed into a top infrastructure company, excelling in logistics and computing infrastructure, as demonstrated by AWS. AWS represents Amazon's most profitable segment, helping other companies utilize Amazon’s advanced infrastructure. In logistics, Amazon’s Fulfillment by Amazon services pose a significant competitive threat to entities like UPS and FedEx. With eighty-six massive fulfillment centers and fifty-eight Prime Now hubs, Amazon offers superior same-day delivery and cost-effective shipping solutions. It leverages “sortation” centers that utilize USPS for cheaper shipping, dramatically undercutting UPS and FedEx's prices.

When Google entered the scene, it was seen merely as another search engine among giants like Yahoo! and Lycos, with expectations that even a significant market share would still leave it in the shadows of Yahoo!'s comprehensive portal services. However, people overlooked two crucial aspects. First, Google's innovative AdWords model—a relevance-based, revenue-maximizing, self-service advertising system—enabled it to generate significantly higher revenue per search than its predecessors. Second, as the Internet grew exponentially, the task of finding relevant information became increasingly vital, enhancing the importance of search itself. This growth, coupled with the explosion of online content, led to a massive market. Google strategically expanded this market by harnessing the strength of its business model to monetize key acquisitions such as Android, Google Maps, and YouTube.

Google’s advanced technology is often credited for its success, but its strategic use of distribution channels also played a crucial role in transforming it from "yet another search engine" to "the last search engine," as Peter Thiel described in his 2014 Stanford lecture. Significant partnerships, like the deal to power AOL’s search results, boosted Google’s growth. Further deals, such as the Firefox partnership, acquiring Android, and launching the Chrome browser, maintained its distribution dominance. Additionally, the AdSense program for Web publishers reinforced its AdWords machine. Google's remarkable 61 percent margin in 2016 wasn't a stroke of luck but a result of its innovative AdWords model, which capitalized on user purchase intent rather than just attracting eyeballs. This enabled Google to earn significantly higher margins per unit of traffic. These robust margins allowed Google to make bold investments in products like Android and Chrome, and fund experimental projects like X and Waymo. Although Google’s core search product hasn’t directly leveraged network effects, many of its other major business lines have.

The mobile traffic app Waze exemplifies a direct network effect; it uses each user’s location data to improve traffic accuracy and facilitates easy reporting of incidents like accidents or speed traps, with all data shared publicly. The app’s value increases with more users. In contrast, the Android mobile operating system showcases indirect network effects, where high user adoption motivates developers to create Android apps, attracting even more users to the platform. YouTube illustrates two-sided network effects by connecting video creators and viewers, where more creators draw in more viewers, and vice versa. Google’s G Suite demonstrates the power of compatibility, standards, and local network effects, similar to Microsoft Office. Users sharing Google Docs or Sheets within a project team or school create pressure for wider adoption among colleagues, students, and parents. This practical experience underscores the importance of achieving product/market fit.

Google nailed the product/market fit with its core search and AdWords products, which vastly outperformed competitors. However, it wasn't an overnight success—initially, Google attempted to sell enterprise search appliances and later tried advertising-supported models by running DoubleClick ads, which it eventually acquired. The breakthrough came with refining Overture's advertising auction model, making AdWords a powerful self-service, relevance-driven system. Google's intentional product management, emphasizing bottom-up innovation and high tolerance for failure, led to major successes like Gmail but also notable failures, including Buzz, Wave, and Glass. Financial strength and a willingness to cut losses enable Google to navigate these failures effectively—illustrated by its pivot from Google Video to acquiring YouTube. Contrasted with Apple’s top-down, focused product development, Google's approach incubates many parallel projects, leveraging operational scalability honed through substantial investments in infrastructure. Each company's strategy emphasizes the importance of finding product/market fit swiftly to stay ahead of the competition.

Google has excelled in people scalability too. Though many of Google's people management strategies are intuitive, like using smaller teams for new products and larger ones for scaling existing products, they've made a significant investment in people analytics. This data-driven approach helps pinpoint the perfect number of interviews per candidate (no more than five) and refines recruitment and performance review practices. 

**CASE #4: FACEBOOK Market Size**

Market size was a significant factor that many underestimated regarding Facebook's potential in its early days. Initially perceived as a “social network for college students,” it seemed like a niche product in an unproven category with a narrow audience. However, when I invested in Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg had a much broader and valuable vision: making Facebook the default way people stayed in touch with friends, targeting a vast market. Despite pitching this expansive vision, many investors were skeptical and would later regret it. Facebook excelled at distribution by focusing initially on college campuses, ensuring a critical mass before launching and leveraging existing friend networks to expand. This strategy spurred incredible virality as users naturally invited their offline friends to join. Although Facebook initially lacked an effective revenue model, it became immensely profitable through sponsored posts in the news feed, with advertising sales now constituting about 90% of its revenue and an impressive 87% gross margin. This financial success enabled significant investments in talent, technology, and strategic acquisitions like Instagram, WhatsApp, and future bets like Oculus, solidifying its dominance in both mobile and desktop social networks.

Facebook's success hinges on its mastery of direct and local network effects, boosting its value as more users join, and the difficulty competitors face in prying those users away. Additionally, indirect network effects from platform services like the Graph API and Facebook Connect enhance its ecosystem. Achieving product/market fit from the start, Facebook's rapid expansion was marked by overcoming significant challenges, including the transition from desktop to mobile, which initially lagged due to a slow mobile experience. Zuckerberg's decisive focus on mobile improvements and acquisitions such as Instagram and WhatsApp paid off, with mobile users now making up a significant portion of Facebook's usage and revenue. Advertiser product/market fit was crucial, as Facebook's superior content algorithms and innovative News Feed ads countered conventional wisdom and effectively monetized mobile engagement. Operationally, Facebook's "Move fast and break things" motto drove quick advancements, though it evolved to include stable infrastructure to handle the growing complexity. As the platform developed, a dual emphasis on speed and stability allowed continued rapid innovation. With a solid business model in place, future strategy necessitates continued innovation to sustain growth.`,
		quarter: `In Part II of the discussion on Business Model Innovation, the focus is on the importance of innovative business models for exponential growth, especially in the Internet era. The dot-com boom showed that traditional business models often failed online, with companies like eToys and giants like Microsoft struggling. In contrast, Amazon, eBay, and Google thrived by shaping sectors with revolutionary business approaches. Beyond technological advancements, success involves innovative products and services supported by effective business models that ensure financial returns, rapid scaling, and sustained competitive edges. Market size is critical; targeting large markets can predict growth and investment returns, highlighted by Airbnb and Uber's market expansions. In Silicon Valley, VCs prioritize investments that promise at least $1 billion in annual sales, passing over smaller ventures for higher returns, as seen with eBay's success. Effective distribution is paramount, with companies like Dropbox thriving due to exceptional distribution strategies. Leveraging existing networks, such as PayPal with eBay or Airbnb with Craigslist, can jumpstart growth. However, reliance on these networks can backfire, requiring resilience, as seen with Zynga's Facebook integration. Virality also plays a key role in growth, with companies like LinkedIn and Dropbox achieving success through organic and incentivized virality. High gross margins are crucial for funding growth, evident in tech giants like Google and Facebook, contrasting with lower-margin industries. Network effects further drive growth by increasing product value with usage, creating customer lock-in and market dominance. Understanding and embedding network effects is essential, as demonstrated by successful companies like eBay, Facebook, and Airbnb.

### Network Effects & Scalability in Tech Business Models

Network effects amplify product value as user bases grow. Direct network effects make platforms like Facebook more valuable with increased usage, while indirect effects enhance products like Windows through complementary goods. Two-sided network effects, as seen in marketplaces like Uber, connect different user groups for mutual benefit. Local network effects, such as unlimited calls to favorites, and compatibility standards, like Microsoft's Word format, also drive product adoption. To thrive, businesses must aggressively expand to reach a critical mass where supply meets demand. My experience at PayPal, initially offering free credit card payments, highlights the need for such growth strategies despite early losses. Geoffrey Moore's advice to target niche markets is critical for crossing the chasm from early adopters to mainstream users. Connectivity today greatly eases reaching these tipping points, fostering dominant, winner-take-all markets. Efficient scaling, leveraging outsourcing like Airbnb with freelance photographers, or platforms like AWS, as Dropbox did, helps manage rapid growth. Challenges like operational scalability and infrastructure demands, exemplified by Friendster's collapse and Twitter's "Fail Whale" phase, underscore the need for robust systems to support surging user bases. Companies like Amazon and Nest have capitalized on modularity and outsourced manufacturing to maintain flexibility and meet demand, whereas Tesla's complex production lines illustrate the difficulties of scaling physical products. Rapidly growing ventures often emulate proven patterns, emphasizing principles over rigid blueprints, helping entrepreneurs navigate the fast-paced tech landscape.

Despite adhering to established business models, not all companies achieve massive profits. Take open-source software, for instance; though it emerged in the dot-com era and revolutionized the tech stack with free, community-driven innovations, it still struggles with profitability. Red Hat, the most successful open-source entity, reached a $15 billion market cap after two decades but didn't turn massive profits. Proven patterns that create substantial value for multiple businesses are crucial for inspiring business model innovation. One such pattern is "Bits Rather Than Atoms," as seen with Google and Facebook, which leverage lower variable costs and rapid innovation cycles to serve a global market. Platforms like iTunes and Amazon amplify value through network effects and seamless transactions, while the freemium model, popularized by Fred Wilson, drives adoption with free basic services leading to monetization through premium options, such as Dropbox's storage upgrades. Marketplaces also thrive by efficiently connecting buyers and sellers, exemplified by Google’s AdWords, and overcoming growth constraints of physical infrastructure. SaaS models, like Salesforce, have transitioned from traditional on-premise solutions to subscription-based services, benefiting from broader reach and predictable revenue. News feeds, introduced by Facebook, have driven engagement and advertising revenue, proving the power of business model innovation. Underlying all these patterns are fundamental principles like Moore’s Law, which fuel technological advancements and enable business model innovations.

*Inspired by these proven patterns, we encourage you to innovate and refine your business models, leveraging the unique advantages each one offers.*

Moore's Law, named after Intel cofounder Gordon Moore, is a foundational principle that has fueled the success of Silicon Valley and the global tech sector. Initially articulated in 1965, it noted the annual doubling of transistors on a silicon chip, later refined to every eighteen months. This concept now extends to predicting a doubling of computing power within this timeframe, thanks to advances like multicore and multithreaded computing. The relentless pace of Moore's Law is powered by human ingenuity, continually driving technological breakthroughs and innovative business models, transitioning from large mainframes to personal technology such as smartphones. Visionaries like Reed Hastings of Netflix have not just adhered to Moore's Law but anticipated its future implications. Despite the technological constraints of 1997, Hastings foresaw the potential for internet-based TV streaming and used DVDs as a precursor to this vision, creating a movie-rental-by-mail business that avoided late fees and harnessed Moore's Law to later transition to streaming. By 2012, Netflix became a leading streaming service, introducing concepts like "binge watching" and funding original content like "Stranger Things." The personalized, on-demand nature of Netflix's service, driven by viewer habits, underscores Hastings' strategic patience with Moore's Law, ultimately transforming Netflix into a media juggernaut. Blitzscaling companies leverage automation, which, powered by Moore's Law, dramatically outpaces human capabilities in speed, cost, and reliability. The transformation from the 1977 Apple II to the 2014 iPhone 5S exemplifies this growth with staggering improvements in clock speed and RAM. Such advancements highlight automation's role in enhancing consumer products and optimizing corporate operations, significantly boosting productivity and efficiency in companies like Amazon and Google.

### UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE #3: ADAPTATION, NOT OPTIMIZATION

In today's fast-paced world, the key to achieving sustainable development is adaptation, not just optimization. While optimization focuses on making current systems more efficient, adaptation emphasizes flexibility and resilience, allowing systems to evolve and thrive amidst changing conditions. This principle reminds us that clinging to rigid, optimized solutions can be counterproductive in the face of unforeseen challenges. By fostering an adaptive mindset, organizations and individuals can better navigate the complexities of modern life and ensure long-term success. Therefore, it's crucial to prioritize adaptation over mere optimization to cope with continuous change and uncertainty.

At a higher level of abstraction, successful scale-ups prioritize adaptation over optimization. Unlike the static, giant assembly lines of Detroit automakers dating back to Henry Ford’s Model T, modern Silicon Valley companies like Amazon and Facebook embrace continuous improvement and constant experimentation. For example, Amazon diversified beyond retail into new markets like AWS, and Facebook transformed from a text-based social network to a rich media platform on smartphones. This adaptive approach is crucial for achieving product/market fit in rapidly changing environments. UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE #4: THE CONTRARIAN PRINCIPLE, as eloquently discussed by my friend Peter Thiel in his book *Zero to One*, hinges on the power of being contrarian.

Whenever I interview someone for a job, I like to ask, “What important truth do very few people agree with you on?” This seemingly simple question challenges both intellectually and psychologically. Courage is needed to present an unpopular truth in a world where school-taught knowledge is widely accepted. Contrarian thinking is key in creating valuable tech companies, giving them an edge to achieve scale without much competition. Icons like Amazon, Google, and Facebook succeeded by pursuing opportunities dismissed by others. Innovation inherently means smart people will disagree with you, as Airbnb’s founders experienced skepticism from investors. This book offers tools to design and evaluate innovative business models, advising against shallow pattern matching like “Uber for Pets.” Effective pattern matching demands understanding the mechanism of action, exemplified by Airbnb’s massive market and viral growth from city to city. Let’s develop skills to analyze billion-dollar business models utilizing these principles of business model innovation.

LinkedIn's journey to becoming a premier professional networking platform was a masterclass in navigating a complex market and recognizing the shift towards online professional identities. Launched in 2002 amidst the dot-com bust, LinkedIn differentiated itself by emphasizing professional engagement and career development tools, and leveraging organic virality for growth. Early monetization efforts included freemium subscriptions and enterprise products, enabling revenue generation while staying true to its core mission. The company overcame initial funding hurdles, convincing investors of its unique value and eventually securing significant investment from Greylock. Scaling operationally, LinkedIn tackled challenges in maintaining dual focus on consumer and enterprise products, and rapidly expanding its salesforce, aided by technological innovations like the Merlin tool. This strategic approach, paired with the network effects of user growth and employer engagement, solidified LinkedIn’s place in the professional ecosystem. Similar strategic insights were seen in other tech giants like Amazon, Google, and Facebook, each capitalizing on market size, network effects, and innovative monetization to dominate their respective fields.`,
