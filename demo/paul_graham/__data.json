I am going to show you a copy of who this guy is from Wikipedia.\n\n**Paul Graham** ([/ɡræm/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English \"Help:IPA/English\"); born November 13, 1964)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)#cite_note-DOB_LibCongress-3) is an English-American [computer scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist \"Computer scientist\"), writer, entrepreneur and investor. His work has included the programming language [Arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_(programming_language) \"Arc (programming language)\"), the startup [Viaweb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viaweb \"Viaweb\") (later renamed *Yahoo! Store*), co-founding the [startup accelerator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_accelerator \"Startup accelerator\") and seed capital firm [Y Combinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator \"Y Combinator\"), his essays, and [Hacker News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_News \"Hacker News\").\n\nHe is the author of the computer programming books *[On Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Lisp \"On Lisp\")*,[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)#cite_note-onlisp-4) *ANSI Common Lisp*,[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)#cite_note-ansi-5) and *[Hackers & Painters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_%26_Painters \"Hackers & Painters\")*.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)#cite_note-hackersandpainters-6) Technology journalist [Steven Levy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Levy \"Steven Levy\") has described Graham as a \"hacker philosopher\".[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)#cite_note-7)\n\nGraham was born in England, where he and his family have maintained a permanent residence since 2016. He is also a citizen of the United States, where he attended all of his schooling and lived for 48 years prior to returning to England.\n\n## Education and early life\n\nGraham and his family moved to [Pittsburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh \"Pittsburgh\"), [Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania \"Pennsylvania\") in 1968, where he later attended [Gateway High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_High_School_(Pennsylvania) \"Gateway High School (Pennsylvania)\"). Graham gained interest in science and mathematics from his father who was a [nuclear physicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_physicist \"Nuclear physicist\").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)#cite_note-early_interest-8)\n\nGraham received a [Bachelor of Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts \"Bachelor of Arts\") with a major in [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy \"Philosophy\") from [Cornell University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University \"Cornell University\") in 1986.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)#cite_note-bio-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)#cite_note-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)#cite_note-11) He then received a [Master of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Science \"Master of Science\") in 1988, and a [Doctor of Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy \"Doctor of Philosophy\") in 1990, both in [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science \"Computer science\") from [Harvard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University \"Harvard University\").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)#cite_note-bio-9)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)#cite_note-SpeakerMix_bio-12)\n\nGraham has also studied painting at the [Rhode Island School of Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island_School_of_Design \"Rhode Island School of Design\") and at the [Accademia di Belle Arti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accademia_di_Belle_Arti_Firenze \"Accademia di Belle Arti Firenze\") in [Florence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence \"Florence\").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)#cite_note-bio-9)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)#cite_note-SpeakerMix_bio-12)\n\n## Career[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paul_Graham_(programmer)&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Career\")]\n\nIn 1996, Graham and [Robert Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Tappan_Morris \"Robert Tappan Morris\") founded [Viaweb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viaweb \"Viaweb\") and recruited [Trevor Blackwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Blackwell \"Trevor Blackwell\") shortly after. They believed that Viaweb was the first [application service provider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_service_provider \"Application service provider\").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)#cite_note-13) Graham received a patent for webapps based on his work at Viaweb.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)#cite_note-14) Viaweb's software, written mostly in [Common Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp \"Common Lisp\"), allowed users to make their own [Internet stores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_store \"Internet store\"). In the summer of 1998, after [Jerry Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Yang \"Jerry Yang\") received a strong recommendation from [Ali Partovi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Partovi \"Ali Partovi\"),[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)#cite_note-15) Viaweb was sold to [Yahoo!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo! \"Yahoo!\") for 455,000 shares of Yahoo! stock, valued at $49.6 million.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)#cite_note-16) After the acquisition, the product became [Yahoo! Store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Store \"Yahoo! Store\").\n\nGraham later gained notice for his essays, which he posts on his personal website. Essay subjects range from *Beating the Averages*,[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)#cite_note-17) which compares Lisp to other [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language \"Programming language\") and introduced the hypothetical programming language *Blub*, to *Why Nerds are Unpopular*,[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)#cite_note-18) a discussion of [nerd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerd \"Nerd\") life in high school. A collection of his essays has been published as *[Hackers & Painters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_%26_Painters \"Hackers & Painters\")*[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)#cite_note-hackersandpainters-6) by [O'Reilly Media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Reilly_Media \"O'Reilly Media\"), which includes a discussion of the growth of Viaweb and the advantages of Lisp to program it.\n\nIn 2001, Graham announced that he was working on a new [dialect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect_(computing) \"Dialect (computing)\") of Lisp named [Arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_(programming_language) \"Arc (programming language)\"). It was released on 29 January 2008.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)#cite_note-19) Over the years since, he has written several essays describing features or goals of the language, and some internal projects at Y Combinator have been written in Arc, including the Hacker News web forum and news aggregator program.\n\nIn 2005, after giving a talk at the [Harvard Computer Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Harvard_Computer_Society&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Harvard Computer Society (page does not exist)\") later published as *How to Start a Startup*, Graham along with [Trevor Blackwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Blackwell \"Trevor Blackwell\"), [Jessica Livingston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Livingston \"Jessica Livingston\"), and [Robert Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Tappan_Morris \"Robert Tappan Morris\") started [Y Combinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator \"Y Combinator\") to provide [seed funding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_funding \"Seed funding\") to [startups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company \"Startup company\"), particularly those started by younger, more technically oriented founders. Y Combinator has invested in more than 1300 startups, including [Reddit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit \"Reddit\"), [Twitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(service) \"Twitch (service)\") (formerly [Justin.tv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin.tv \"Justin.tv\")), [Xobni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xobni \"Xobni\"), [Dropbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropbox_(service) \"Dropbox (service)\"), [Airbnb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb \"Airbnb\"), and [Stripe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stripe_(company) \"Stripe (company)\").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)#cite_note-20)\n\n*[BusinessWeek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BusinessWeek \"BusinessWeek\")* included Paul Graham in the 2008 edition of its annual feature, *The 25 Most Influential People on the Web*.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)#cite_note-21)\n\nIn response to the proposed [Stop Online Piracy Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act \"Stop Online Piracy Act\") (SOPA), Graham announced in late 2011 that no representatives of any company supporting it would be invited to Y Combinator's Demo Day events.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)#cite_note-Demo_Day_SOPA_cutoff-22)\n\nIn February 2014, Graham stepped down from his day-to-day role at Y Combinator.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)#cite_note-23)\n\nIn October 2019, Graham announced a [specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_specification \"Technical specification\") for another new dialect of Lisp, written in itself, named Bel.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)#cite_note-24)","### About Paul Graham\n\nUnder this page, I'd like to introduce you to Paul Graham, a prominent figure in the tech industry.

Graham gained recognition for his essays on various topics, ranging from programming languages to high school nerd life, and published a collection titled *Hackers & Painters*. In 2001, he began working on a new Lisp dialect named Arc, releasing it in 2008. Some Y Combinator projects, including Hacker News, were developed using Arc. In 2005, after a Harvard talk, Graham, along with Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Morris, founded Y Combinator, which has since invested in over 1300 startups such as Reddit, Dropbox, and Airbnb. Graham was featured in BusinessWeek’s 2008 list of The 25 Most Influential People on the Web. He took a stand against SOPA in 2011 by excluding supporters from Y Combinator events. In 2014, he stepped down from his daily role at Y Combinator and announced another Lisp dialect named Bel in 2019.","\n### About Paul Graham\n\nPaul Graham, a significant figure in the tech industry, was born on November 13, 1964.
